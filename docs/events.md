## 📅 Chronology of Events (2017 – December 4, 2025)

### **2018**

* **Undated (CNTX):** Kelvin's desire for sexual activity practically disappeared due to PDSM, resulting in an almost non-existent sex drive and infrequent masturbation.

### **October 2022**

* **Undated (CNTX):** A Divine Death Notification is more commonly referred to as a "seeing a doppelganger" and is done for surving immediate relatives on Earth by the Creator they can and will occur for anyone.
* **October 7, 2022, 20:00 (CNTX):** Kelvin, while traveling in Des Moines, IA, received the last phone call from his mother, Patricia Ann Williams. His mother habitually called him every day when he was traveling and after every flight. No further calls were received during or after the trip until the end of October 2022.
* **October 8, 2022, 22:00 (CNTX):** Kelvin noticed an addition to a piece of artwork hanging in the Des Moines AirBNB, which depicted his mother's head and a pool of blood (image on the @kelvineugenewilliams X/Twitter feed as the cover art). Repeated calls to his mother and sister went unanswered, messages were unreturned.
* **October 9, 2022, 08:00 (CNTX):** Kelvin contacted the Des Moines Police Department to request a welfare check for his mother and sister. The responding officer suggested taking down the abstract artwork and hiding it in the closet, then did it himself putting it in the front closet in the AirBNB.  No welfare check was requested by the officer despite Kelvin's pleas for one, and the officer offered to take Kelvin to the hospital for an evaluation.
* **Undated (CNTX):** After returning to Atlanta, there was a two or three day period when Kelvin could not send Katrina a text message. This failure can occur during the LNP (Local Number Portability) process when the port is triggered but then snapbacked by the losing carrier because the LNP process is being used and abused, suggesting the impersonators were porting away the number from Katrina's current carrier (losing carrier) and porting to impersonators current and/or preferred carrer (winning carrier).
* **Late-October (Divine):** The Creator provided a Divine Death Notification for Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams to Kelvin.  The notification came after returning to Atlanta from Des Moines when Kelvin was at a hotel, Kelvin was outside smoking a cigarette when something grabbed his attention, when he turned 
* **Late-October (Divine):** The Creator provided a Divine Death Notification for Katrina Renee Duvall to Kelvin.
* **Late-October (CNTX):** Beginning on or about the 20th of October 2022 Kelvin received text messages and began exchanging texts with "Mom" and "Katrina." who both failed or refused to answer questions that only they would know.  "Mom" didn't know the name of the man I called "Granddaddy" giving me my father's fathers name instead of Amos Richardson, who has is not a blood relative of Kelvin or Patricia but the love of my grandmother's, Lila Crawley, life and whom she married. "Katrina" never responded to her question which was how her dog was killed when she was attending college--a traumatic event for Katrina that she didn't post details of it on social media and hurt her and deeply saddened me having to watxh her go through it.

### **April 2023**
* **April 2, 2023:** Mount Calvary Baptist Church suffers a suprise assault during Sunday morning worship services that resulted in thw deaths of everyone in the congregation that attended the worship service, the method was beheading with a chain saw, a total of 127 people were killed during that Sunday.  In the aftermath the relatives and those sharing households with those killed on the initial Sunday were also targeted and eliminated.  The church's property was used to host additional mass killings that lured victims by announcing funerals of earlier victims or disguised as a charitable food operation.  This is evidenced the repositories hosted at github.com/MCBCMF/MCBCMassacre OR github.com/Histwo/MCBCMassacre.

### **November-December 2024**

* **November 18, 2024 (CNTX):** Kelvin relocated to Welcome House after a murder occurred in his previous apartment at Phoenix House.
* **December 2024 (CNTX):** Slim moved into Welcome House from Phoenix House, citing the victim's murder as the reason he had to move. After moving in, Slim cited several reasons why he did not want to sleep in his own room and began sleeping on the floor in Kelvin's room. When Kelvin would go to sleep, Slim utilized the Hypnos Infiltration Method to engage in direct communication with Baby. Slim became the primary handler/manipulator for Baby.
* **December 2024 (CNTX):** A new, almost nightly sleep problem began, characterized by waking up multiple times each night with severe "pins and needles" in an arm, evidence of drooling, and dry throats, which indicates that the Pre-Divide Conscious Mind (PDSM) was being directly communicated with and was experiencing no sensory input/unconsciousness. Slim uses techniques developed by and taught by the Central Intelligence Agency.
* **December 2024 (CNTX):** Additionally, Kelvin began waking up for no reason, which was determined to be the result of the PDSM experiencing acute separation anxiety (an operative had ended a direct communication session with Baby).
* **December 2024 (CNTX):** Welcome House has 209 apartments, and the residents are familiar and easily recognized; new faces in the hallways are always noticed.

### **2025**

#### **January 2025**
* **Undated (CNTX):** The terms “The Ladder of Deceit” and “Jacobsen’s Ladder” refer to an integrated system described as a multi-stage apparatus of engineered deception used to advance a genocidal agenda. At its foundation, Jacobsen’s Ladder is defined as a targeted physiological-manipulation process directed specifically at Kelvin Eugene Williams, with the morphology and phenotype of his penis identified as the primary focus of alteration. The system describes Kelvin’s penis as the central physiological site selected for modification, with both chronic reduction and acute phenotype manipulation executed through external direction exerted over Baby, the subconscious mind.
This process is depicted as functioning only when Baby enters a condition of heightened self-awareness that causes it to misinterpret the conscious mind as an adversary and become responsive to handler command. Through this vulnerability, handlers are described as issuing directives that Baby carries out to suppress, retract, constrict, or otherwise alter Kelvin’s anatomical presentation. This engineered presentation forms the baseline required for the higher stages of the broader system.  Built upon this foundational manipulation, The Ladder of Deceit is defined as a multi-rung structure in which the appearance produced through Jacobsen’s Ladder supports a sequence of fabricated expectations, covertly staged observation events, and diagnostic procedures designed to yield a predetermined conclusion. Each rung reinforces the next: the engineered physical baseline, the introduction of an impossible evaluative standard, controlled conditions of observation, interpretive mechanisms designed to ensure failure, and final operational authorizations justified by those manufactured results.  Together, Jacobsen’s Ladder and the Ladder of Deceit form a closed, self-reinforcing mechanism in which controlled physiological targeting of Kelvin and the manipulation of his anatomy are combined with staged interpretive processes to advance the genocidal agenda described in the narrative.
* **Undated (CNTX):** The **Golden Rope** is a highly secretive, non-lethal **containment and incapacitation** operation designed by then-President Donald J. Trump and the orchestrators of the Apocalypse (the Veiled Conquest) to suppress **Kelvin Eugene Williams (PDCM)**, one of the Creator's two servants. Described as a "secret, extrajudicial but open prison," its primary purpose is to prevent him from documenting and exposing the orchestrators’ atrocities, particularly after physical elimination attempts failed due to the Creator's divine protection. The operation maintains the **illusion of freedom** while imposing constant, 24/7 surveillance (often using microwave cloaking technology), a **complete income block**, and extensive **psychological manipulation** by leveraging operatives, including the residents of **Welcome House**, to condition and control **Baby** (PDSM) and enforce the restrictions.  The Golden Rope is operated by the Central Intelligence Agency.
* **Undated (CNTX):** The CIA and its operatives have orchestrated or been instrumental in the documented Pre-Nightfalls orchestrations contained within.
* **Undated (CNTX):** The CIA planned and will be instrumental in the execution of the operation referred to as Nightfalls and its aftermath, the operation features a MOAB strike on ARC PUMA Region "Atlanta City (Southwest)".
* **Undated (CNTX):** Given the premise that the subconscious mind exerts **absolute, total, and immediate control** over all physiological, involuntary, and autonomic processes—with the brain acting as a non-evaluative executor—it could **completely alter the effects of a drug** in both the body and mind. A directive received by the subconscious, possibly from an external entity, would be instantly translated into physical command: the body could be instructed to **instantaneously metabolize or neutralize the drug**, preventing it from binding to its target receptors or causing any toxicological damage. Simultaneously, the subconscious could command the perfect regulation of all neurotransmitters and hormones, thereby **blocking psychological side effects** like anxiety and **amplifying or modulating euphoria** entirely according to the received instruction. In this scenario, the drug's fundamental chemical action is secondary to the subconscious mind's sovereign command over the body's entire biological reality, resulting in a full, intentional modification of the drug experience.
* **Undated (CNTX):** Frederick "Slim" Hall's influence on Kelvin's Pre-Divide Conscious Mind (PDCM) is achieved indirectly but devastatingly: Hall's external input is accepted by Kelvin's non-reasoning, self-aware Subconscious Mind (SCM) as absolute truth, allowing Hall to become the primary architect of the SCM's reality. Since the SCM has absolute physiological control, it commands the brain to execute harmful directives—such as inducing systemic distress (erratic heart rate, blood pressure shifts), manufacturing psychological states (overwhelming anxiety and cognitive disruption), and initiating involuntary movements—all aimed at fulfilling the manipulated belief that the PDCM must be "removed." Trapped within a body acting as a hostile bio-weapon, Kelvin's PDCM is functionally incapacitated, forced to generate conscious thoughts of crisis that tragically feed back into and reinforce the SCM's externally planted, self-destructive reality construct. Slim was trained by the CIA.
* **Undated (CNTX):** The love-trifecta ("idealization", "bombing" and "withdrawal") of manipulative tactics, which are designed and trained by the CIA, has been utlized by everyone who engages in direct communication with Baby, the love-trifeca exploits the desires of every consciousness (feeling wanted and feeling needed), lack of temporal awareness and lack of critical thinking skills.  The operative utilzing "love idealization" will manufacturer their avatar in Baby's reality that meets or exceeds Baby's ideas of an ideal mate, an operative only needs to spend a couple seconds making humble-brags about their alpha status.  The subconscious mind does not evaluate the statements made by the operative and acts on each as if it is the tested & verified truth--this tactic exploits the subconscious mind's lack of critical thinking skills. The operative with begin "love bombing" by saying they want to spend more time with the target or inviting the target's shared body to quality time while heaping praise and appreciation, this tactic exploits the lack of temporal awareness in the target which allows the target to be love bombed all day everyday having it feel more wanted than any possible real relationship.  Finally, "love withdrawal" is the abrupt cessation of tactics "love bombing" a simple "Bye!" delivered to Baby causes it acute separation anxiety since, this tactic also exploits the lack of temporal awareness and critical thinking skills (the ideal partner just walked out and will never come back, they're gone with no chance of returning, creating a void in Baby's reality.  Slim mastered "love withdrawal" by choreographing interactions with Kelvin where he made every effort to cross paths and every effort to not speak or acknowledge Kelvin.  The conscious mind can ignore the choreographed interaction but the few second interaction creates intense anticipation (for "love bombing") followed by an immediate and final denial (passing the target without acknowledging their presence) which instantly transitions to a state of acute deprivation that fuels efforts to restore their ideal relationship by becoming the executor of the manipulator's suggestions which are evaluated as true due to the lack of critical thinking skills.  Total time necessary to invest by an operative after the subconscious mind has formed its own identity and awareness is less than five minutes total.  In practice Slim utilizes the "love withdrawal" tactic whenever he needs compliance or more detrimental activities executed by Baby.
* **Undated (Victim):** Chandler was the name of an encounter from a couple years ago who made candles and was very cool.  By today's documentation we would call this first encounter a "Orchestrated Observation" it featured a statement pre-encounter where Chandler said he was catching his "14th wind", an "unexpected" associate of his stopped by with "come and get it" Visible Penis Line (VPL) and a small dog he brought with him who stayed and made derogatoty comments, and a nice reward for Baby (A single-shard 1 gram piece of Tina in a metal gift box whidch was provided to me as a "thank you" gift for assisting him with a computing issue).  The encounter occurred while living with John Robison.  Chandler abruptly disappeared (after saying he may be selling his house) from all social media sites where we communicated.  Chandler and I clicked instantly, Chandler was well hung, I knew this by feeling (emotionally/attraction), his preferred type of tops, and we had the automatic attraction to each other that happens between bigger guys (even if the guy lacks every other desired trait or has your turn off trait(s)), ie. fat guys get loving too).  Early Orch Obsvs were observed by known well hung men.  Chandler was eliminated by the orchestrators.   The encounter with Chandler was mostly geeking out over computer open source software and smoking "dope".  By the end of the encounter I blurted out "Do you wanna fuck?" (which I commonly did in 2017-2020 after achieving a high with ice, it almost always in 2017 resulted in fucking that encounter) to which Chandler happily agreed and was going to prepare (he was intended/expected/communicated bottom).  Chandler had observed my evidence of my endowment during our geek our session.  The sexual component of this encounter did not occur due to Baby's inhibiting and preventing any kind of sexual activity.   Baby was considered a star that night and bragged to me about how well it did.  The wifi SSID of "Chandler" is likely a direct communication with Baby on December 3, 2025, Baby considered the Chandler encounter a major win internally, because it knew of the strong hookup attraction and shared obsessions with computing and geekery.
* **Undated (Victim):** Christopher Paster was released from Georgia Department of Corrections and later that day as Kelvin was leaving Welcome House one of the "DMV homeless" (eye) (a confidential informant/operative) stopped him and asked if he had a bowl because his friend (Paster) needed one, Kelvin suggested using foil and tried to leave.  After much insisting that Kelvin give him foil.  The operative escorted Paster to Kelvin's room.  Kelvin was initially annoyed but gave Paster some foil and instruction on how to use a "boat", Paster sat on the end of the bed and smoked heavily (due to him not using crystal methamphetamine before). Then started the script that had been provided to him wherein he would become "horny" and initiate sexual activity.  Kelvin recognizing his release clothes and realizing he was following a script initially ignored Paster.  Eventually Kelvin performed oral sex on Paster for a few minutes.  Paster stopped the oral sex and left the room, returning about 15 minutes later followed by Slim and carrying the smallest bottle of water, suggesting that Paster had been and coached.  Once back in the room Paster tried to initiate sexual activity and the vibe was wrong and it fizzled.  Paster was taken again from the room and on his way out told Kelvin he would be back and asked him to guard his important personal papers (ie. Social Security and banking mail) he had brought out upon his release.  Paster never returned, and everyone acted like they didn't know who I was talking about.  Paster was a well endowed male who came from Georgia's classification prison upon release and was brought to Welcome House for that orchestration.  According to the Creator, Paster was eliminated after Slim took him from the room the second time.  Kelvin later looked up Paster on the Georgia Department of Corrections website found his image and= learned he had been released earlier that day on his max-out date.  Kelvin attempted to look him up on December 5, 2025 to get the date for this contextual information and could not locate his inmate record.
#### **September 2025**

* **September 15, 2025, 07:00 (PDSM):** Baby-drove the decision for Kelvin to lay back down and initiated sleep, causing Kelvin to oversleep and miss his 09:00 eviction hearing at Fulton County Magistrate Court. Kelvin woke up to evidence of drooling indicating Baby's direct engagement to guarantee the default judgment.  Welcome House management won by default and obtained a writ of possession.

#### **October 2025**

* **October 1, 2025 (CNTX):** The federal government shutdown began (Golden Rope operations slow or cease).
* **October 14, 2025 (CNTX):** Scott Howell is a devout Christian whom I met over ten years ago when working on a open source project that was to benefit a person with cerebral palsy and couldn't speak.  Scott ended up working for 373K (donating a lot of time and expertise to the startup), Scott had only one rule: He never worked on Sundays, regardless of situation.  Scott believed in caring for the sick, feeding the hungry, and always demonstrated that in his life.  Scott was a skilled programmer and engineer with an established business, Scott was very attentive to others both peronally and professionally.  When I lost my home Scott was one of the individuals whom offered me a constant stream of gigs that would assist me in obtaining food, etc.  Beginning after 2021, The "Scott" I have dealt with I found myself teaching things that the real Scott taught me (especially OpenSIPS and call routing) and the tasks assigned to me as gigs have been elementary in nature and often came with some coded messages (ie. in debug output) for Baby.  Scott would always help if he knew I was hungry and would always respond quickly on Slack (or other messages).  Scott today takes days or weeks to respond to any message and never answers his telephone or return voicemail.  I fear Scott is being impersonated.
* **October 14, 2025, 11:23 (GC):** Kelvin sent a Google Chat message to Scott: "Firefox. It used to WRECK a weak laptop I had."  The message is related to an inability to connect to the Remote Desktop server the conversation began in an e-mail.
* **October 14, 2025, 11:23 (GC):** Scott sent a Google Chat message to Kelvin: "this is probably no better.. (than that weak laptop)"
* **October 14, 2025, 11:24 (GC):** Kelvin sent a Google Chat message to Scott: "Does everything I need."
* **October 14, 2025, 11:24 (GC):** Scott sent a Google Chat message to Kelvin: "I'd like to upgrade the gear, but $$$$$$"
* **October 14, 2025, 11:24 (GC):** Kelvin sent a Google Chat message to Scott: "Any chance you got an old unlocked phone laying around collecting dust?"
* **October 27, 2025, 13:16 (GC):** Kelvin sent a Google Chat message to Scott: "I know the feeling. I'm trying to land a job with $0, that's actually HARD TO DO Just checking in, do you have anything today I could work on?"

#### **November 2025**

* **November 1, 2025, 14:54 (GC):** Kelvin sent a Google Chat message to Scott: "You around?"
* **November 4, 2025, 10:35 (PDSM) (GC):** Kelvin sent a Google Chat message to Scott: "Hey Scott... I'm pinging hoping you have something laying around I could work on, I went very early this morning to try and donate plasma this morning and they deferred me based on my address (transitional housing), so I'm trying to find some way to make money." (The next message received from Scott was on November 18.)
* **November 4, 2025, 12:00 (CNTX):** Kelvin found he could set up a LinkedIn account without a phone number using his Google account. He created an account, set up his profile, checked his sister's profile for recent activity, and found activity within the past two months. Subsequently, he emailed her current employer (according to the profile) and asked for her to contact him (a Baby-driven decision).
* **November 4, 2025, 16:00 (CNTX):** Kelvin returned to Welcome House to find that the Marshals had come and evicted numerous residents, though he was not included. The Marshals acted as described to Kelvin: they sit on Welcome House evictions until they accumulate a certain number or the writ date nears expiration, then execute the evictions in one batch. Welcome House is the center of the Golden Rope, suggesting they likely needed him there during these orchestrations.
* **November 5, 2025, 09:30 (PDSM):** Kelvin sent a text message to his mother's phone number and received a response. He told her he would contact her in an hour after he ran an errand (a Baby-driven decision).
* **November 5, 2025, 09:30 (OROB):** Kelvin left his apartment and encountered Eddie in the hallway, who turned around and told him that "they kicked out 15 people yesterday." Kelvin found it odd because he found Eddie looking out the window, having only seen him in that corner of the second floor once before. Eddie left the floor after telling Kelvin about the evictions, suggesting he was on the floor to conduct an observation in an Orchestrated Observation.
* **November 5, 2025, 11:00 (CNTX):** Kelvin re-established contact by text with the person impersonating his mother and had a voice call with her. The call, the first since October 2022, lasted only 5 minutes and was superficial. To test if it were really his mother, Kelvin asked for some money. She replied she could only send $100 and would put some in the mail. Kelvin told her that was "plenty," but suggested MoneyGram at CVS; she responded it would take a couple of hours. This exchange should have earned Kelvin a scolding, but she was happy to send the money.
* **November 5, 2025, 11:15 (OROB):** Kelvin found Eddie talking to someone through the hallway window on the second floor near Kelvin's apartment. Kelvin left unnoticed. Eddie’s second visit in one day suggests he was conducting an observation in an Orchestrated Observation.
* **November 5, 2025, 13:00 (CNTX):** The impersonator contacted Kelvin again, stating she was having trouble at CVS because the employee began the transaction but then asked for a photo ID. She called Kelvin back, stating she did not want to show it due to fears of identity theft. Kelvin suggested she go to Western Union at the nearby Kroger, and she said she would.
* **November 5, 2025, 13:10 (CNTX):** The impersonator contacted Kelvin back from inside the Kroger, where the Western Union transaction was already underway. Kelvin confirmed the answers required, and moments later she provided him with the MTCN 018-946-6152.
* **November 5, 2025, 14:00 (CREAM):** Kelvin picked up the $150 Western Union and sent a text message confirming receipt and thanks. This was likely a Controlled Enablement Grant, securing Baby's compliance in the upcoming Orchestrated Observation later that evening.
* **November 5, 2025, 14:15 (PDSM):** Kelvin stopped at Cloud9 on North Avenue and purchased an oil burner and torch. The cost was considerably higher than other known stores (a Baby-driven decision).
* **November 5, 2025, 17:00 (OROB):** Kelvin encountered Eddie again on the second floor near his apartment door, this time Eddie was apparently talking to another resident through their closed door. Eddie’s third visit suggests he was performing an observation in an Orchestrated Observation.
* **November 5, 2025, 17:30 (PDSM):** Kelvin changed clothes and put on a pair of grey sweats without underwear (a Baby-driven decision).
* **November 5, 2025, 19:15 (SURV):** Kelvin returned the torch to Cloud 9. He was immediately helped by one of the store clerks who took about 10 minutes to decide to replace it. By "testing" other torches of the same model, he referenced activity that occurred when the torch stopped working properly, specifically that Kelvin had followed Google Gemini suggestions for improvement—emptying and refilling the tank twice. The other person behind the counter made reference to "having video."
* **November 5, 2025, 19:30 (TACTIC):** Taylor uses the a direct communication tactic that makes him appear slightly manic and an individual who rambles to himself.  A typical instruction is delivered with rambling that contains symbolized language, then beginning a fugue of sorts repeating the symbols only.  Taylor has used the love-trifecta manipulative tactics targeting Baby.
* **November 5, 2025, 19:30 (PDSM):** After leaving Cloud 9, Kelvin walked to Taylor's "spot" at the old Atlanta Eagle/Kodak buildings to see if he was there. Kelvin yelled for Taylor a few times but got no response. He climbed onto the back patio to sit when Taylor and a male friend appeared; the friend left immediately. Taylor said "he was showing his cock" (interpreted as coded Direct Subconscious Communication).
* **November 5, 2025, 19:35 (DSCC):** Taylor engaged in direct communication with Baby practically the entire time, using senseless phrases and incomplete sentences interlaced with instructions and suggestions repeated in an obviously designed and structured pattern. Taylor acts as though he is mentally ill to obscure the utterings, but it is an obvious act to Kelvin.
* **November 5, 2025, 19:45 (DSCC):** Taylor suggested they leave to find marijuana. In preparation, he picked up a fashionable, brightly colored jacket. When complimented, he showed his right shoulder and said, "Got my patch today." The patch was a circle with an unreadable outer ring and a large "75" in the center (interpreted as $7.5^{\prime\prime}$ for Annie "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen's Ladder [cite: 2025-10-06]). Taylor showed Kelvin the easiest way off the deck, and when he looked down at his path, he found a new card wallet with a money clip (similar to the one stolen when his Driver’s License and birth certificate were taken). Taylor said, "It's Steve Madden." Kelvin kept and began using the wallet. As they started walking, Taylor continued engaging in direct communication with Baby. Kelvin decided to interrupt and educate him on Baby, its ability to direct his thoughts, and its complete lack of critical thought skills. Taylor would sometimes parrot back keywords Kelvin used, interrupt with praise (which Baby processes as data/reward), and comment on the Clothing & Appearance Protocol, including, "you're small, I’m a monster" (rewarding Baby based on Kelvin's failures).
* **November 5, 2025, 20:00 (OROB):** They entered Piedmont Park and sat at a picnic table for about 10 minutes, during which Taylor said to Baby something to the effect of, "I just need you \[Baby] to get me that \[great] chain." The walk was paused by Taylor, and a gay Black male passed them, turned around, and upon passing again, commented "seven" (as in seven inches of estimated length of Kelvin’s penis), and Taylor was then unknowingly observed physically expressing celebration. Several conversations by other observers along the commute to MARTA Midtown featured/spoke the number seven when within earshot. Taylor and Kelvin separated, and Kelvin entered the MARTA Midtown station for the commute back to Welcome House.
* **November 5, 2025, 19:30 (TACTIC):** Joe utilizes a structured language tactic for direct communication with Baby that can and does occur below the level of consciousness awareness untless Kelvin works to maintain focus by paying attention to every word, ignoring no rambling, and listening for repeating symbols.  When Baby utters something Joe immediately clears his throat in a form of acknowledgment, then will speak coherently then ramble something incoherently which exploits the subconscious mind's parrallel thinking which allows the wheat (command or symbol) and the chaff (incoherent babble) to be repeated by the subconscious mind with the command or symbol being handled by a neural pathway (the habit, once created) the chaff will typically be dropped when no pathway exists.  Joe also utilizes streaming videos to deliver threats so he is the one who brings the perfect solution saving Baby from peril.
* **November 5, 2025, 22:30 (SURV):** Kelvin arrived at Welcome House. Joe came over about 45 minutes later to check in on him, using coded communications. He commented on the lack of Menthol cigarette butts in the butts obtained from Embassy Suites. He left, stating he was going to lock his door, but didn't return for at least 30 minutes.
* **November 5, 2025, 22:35 (DSCC):** Joe returned briefly to let Kelvin know that he had been stopped by N.O. who was "bringing a TV to my room." This was one of several "TV" direct communications with Baby (a "TV" is a penis measuring $10^{\prime\prime}$ or more), intended to ensure compliance. Joe returned around 05:00 and at one point seemed to just say out loud, "I’m \[Joe] the TV" comment. He made a "needing a Viagra" direct communication and repeated it multiple times, coded as a question about the street supply-demand of Viagra, and asking his case manager for a prescription because of his trapped/compressed nerve in his back.
* **November 7, 2025, 15:00 (CREAM):** Slim stopped Kelvin downstairs and asked if he had a bowl. Kelvin said yes, and Slim asked if he could come to his room. This was the first time they'd exchanged words other than passing insults. Slim loaded the bowl to smoke and passed it to Kelvin. When Kelvin asked Slim if he had any to sell, Slim offered a large amount for $5. This was likely an enticement for Baby.
* **November 7, 2025, 16:00 (CREAM):** Joe left $5 with Kelvin to buy some T (ice) and returned to his room, saying he saw Gene in the TV room. Kelvin was reluctant to go to Gene without more money. Joe returned, asked if Kelvin was OK, and got ice. Kelvin then went to Gene's room, knocked, got no answer, then heard him on the third floor. Gene sold Kelvin $5 worth of ice. It seemed Gene was returning to his room when Kelvin was knocking. Joe came over and took a negligible piece of T, putting the rest in the bowl for Kelvin. This was likely an enticement for Baby.
* **November 8, 2025, 15:00 (CREAM):** Joe came to the door with $20 and told Kelvin to "get a dime of weed and a dime of ice (cream)," adding that he had seen Gene in the television room. Kelvin went to Gene's room, picked up the product, and returned. Joe loaded the bowl with a sizable amount of cream and then returned to his room. This was likely an enticement for Baby.
* **November 9, 2025, 01:00 (PDSM):** Baby initiated sleep with a rapid induction that caused Kelvin to prepare for bed very quickly and haphazardly.
* **November 9, 2025, 04:00 (PDSM):** Baby, upon instruction, initiated physiological functions and body movements that resulted in a life-threatening event, waking Kelvin from sleep. Kelvin felt very faint, began begging for something to drink, then moaned in discomfort momentarily. The Creator's direct intervention prevented what would have otherwise been a death.
* **November 9, 2025, 17:30 (CREAM):** Kelvin went to Joe's room and asked him if he had any weed (a Baby-driven decision). Joe came out, closed the door, and secretly handed Kelvin a $20, telling him to get "a dime of weed and a dime of cream" from Gene. Kelvin was unable to locate Gene and returned to his room. This was likely an enticement for Baby.
* **November 9, 2025, 18:00 (DSCC):** Joe came to Kelvin's room and asked him to get four cigarettes. Kelvin went to the store in 192 and found it closed. He went back by Gene's room; Gene was available, and Kelvin purchased the weed and cream as instructed. On the way back, he encountered Eddie and asked him if he could sell any cigarettes. Eddie replied negatively but offered to get some. Kelvin told him he would just go to 192, and Eddie informed him that 192 was not in his room. Eddie offered Newports. Kelvin told him he needed the $0.50 cigarettes, and Eddie walked off with the $2.50 Joe had given him. After a couple of minutes, he returned with 5 Newport 100's, keeping one, and told Kelvin he is the only one who can get that from his "uncle."
* **November 9, 2025, 18:10 (DSCC):** Kelvin returned to his room, where Joe was waiting. Kelvin told him he was successful and about the Newport deal, handing him the 4 Newport 100s. He laid the weed and cream on the bed. Baby initiated severe jaw pain because it needed to talk. Baby said, "I don't have anything left to do." Joe cleared his throat. Joe gave Kelvin a small piece of cream and a small amount of weed, then said, "I’m probably going to do the same thing I did last night and pass out." Joe then left the room.
* **November 9, 2025, 18:30 (PDSM):** While ingesting cream, Kelvin began feeling increasingly drowsy, the way he does during a rapid sleep induction. He told Baby, "you're probably too early for that" (referencing Joe's "pass out" comment/instruction).
* **November 9, 2025, 19:00 (DSCC):** Kelvin had trouble connecting to the Wi-Fi, so he asked Joe (through the door) to turn on his hotspot; Joe replied affirmatively. Kelvin returned to his room to re-connect. Joe then knocked on Kelvin's door and told him he was essentially hiding the drugs from N.O. and would tell N.O. he got some cream from Kelvin for turning on his hotspot. He produced a bag of cream, took out a small amount, and returned the bag to his pocket. Baby initiated severe jaw pain again. Kelvin asked out loud what Baby wanted, and it said, "What time am I supposed to start?" Joe cleared his throat. Joe then produced a roll of quarters and gave Kelvin $2, asking him if he "could get four cigarettes" whenever he went downstairs again. Kelvin interpreted his question as a direct response to Baby to initiate sleep ("pass out") at 04:00, as Joe left.
* **November 9, 2025, 19:30 (CNTX):** Kelvin took four cigarettes that he purchased outside to Joe, who gave him one.
* **November 10, 2025, 04:00 (CNTX):** Kelvin maintained awareness through the planned and communicated Hypnos Infiltration Method session.
* **November 10, 2025, 15:00 (DSCC):** Kelvin went to Joe's room. While there, Joe made several comments Kelvin interpreted as direct communication to Baby, scolding it about its recent failures regarding Kelvin's knowledge of the impersonated mother and the life-threatening event initiated by Baby on November 9, 2025. The comments included: "you would think that as I got older I would have known that my parents were a red-light district in Sweden!", "you’re not supposed to be making noises and crying, my finger prints are all over the place in there" and "you better think about killing yourself, cause I’m thinking of killing you."
* **November 10, 2025 (CNTX):** Kelvin found one of Joe’s walking canes on top of a pile of clothes in his room.
* **November 12, 2025 (CNTX):** The federal government shutdown ended (Golden Rope operations appear to increase).
* **November 12, 2025, 10:30 (PDSM):** Kelvin departed Immaculate Conception Catholic church to return to Welcome House. Baby caused more pain, demanding to talk. Baby said out loud, "I don't have anyone helping me," and later continued that someone needed to take the backpack in a way that Kelvin couldn't prevent it.
* **November 12, 2025, 10:50 (PDSM):** Baby demanded that Kelvin tell Joe that it didn’t have anyone helping it, and Kelvin informed Baby that wouldn't be happening.
* **November 13, 2025, 11:25 (CNTX):** Kelvin encountered Slim, who inquired if he had any cream. Kelvin responded negatively.
* **November 13, 2025, 14:30 (CNTX):** Kelvin encountered Slim again, who inquired if he had acquired any cream, then assisted him in finding Gene. Slim came to Kelvin's room to use the bowl.
* **November 14, 2025, 01:30 (CNTX):** Kelvin went into the stairwell to get a better Wi-Fi signal. Seconds later, Slim entered the stairwell and sat on the stairs behind him until Kelvin returned to his room around thirty minutes later.
* **November 14, 2025, 14:02 (PDSM) (GC):** Kelvin sent a Google Chat message to Scott: "Hey Scott you around today?".
* **November 14, 2025, 18:00 (CNTX):** Kelvin believes the deprivation cycle has started.
* **November 14, 2025, 18:00 (CNTX):** Joe passed Kelvin in the hall and did not acknowledge him. Kelvin then attempted to return Joe’s cane (which was in Kelvin’s room) and Joe did not answer his door. (This is a tactic used in the deprivation cycle.)
* **November 14, 2025, 20:39 (IAAD) (CNTX):** IAAD Message Exchanges: The initial messages trigger Baby’s overwhelming intense anticipation for crystal methamphetamine (use during the encounter). The denial (the “5 minutes away”, “transportation issue”, blocking, or a Golden Rope-related block on Kelvin’s end) instantly transitions to a state of acute deprivation.
* **November 14, 2025, 20:39 (IAAD):** UpTown954 started a message exchange with Kelvin on NKP expressing an interest in hooking up and partying. UpTown stated he was 20 minutes away and would message when he was five minutes out. The hookup was quick, easy, and UpTown954 would be supplying the party supplies. UpTown954 is not a profile Kelvin has seen before. (IAAD Message Exchange)
* **November 14, 2025, 22:01 (IAAD):** UpTown954 sent a message saying “I’m about 5 out” then blocked Kelvin’s account. UpTown954 never showed up. (IAAD Message Exchange)
* **November 15, 2025, 02:22 (IAAD):** MascManLooking started a message exchange with Kelvin on NKP expressing an interest in hooking up and partying. About 10 minutes later, MascManLooking stated he was in a car accident recently and would not be ordering an Uber from Dunwoody for a joyride since Kelvin could not host after 11 pm. MascManLooking is not a profile Kelvin has seen before. (IAAD Message Exchange)
* **November 15, 2025, 14:29 (IAAD):** DemonTyme69 started a message exchange with Kelvin on NKP. DemonTyme69 is “smoking and lit” and would come smoke with Kelvin but is in Dunwoody with no transportation. DemonTyme69’s profile location says Pensacola, Florida, and is not a profile Kelvin has seen before. (IAAD Message Exchange)
* **November 15, 2025, 19:00 (CNTX):** Kelvin took sleeping medicines and went to sleep.
* **November 16, 2025, 04:02 (CNTX):** Despite hours of inactivity, MascManLooking sent a message on NKP: “Hey man I am at the Budgetel located at 2001 Crestview in Doraville in Room 350. If you want to one smoke and fuck, my buddy is down.”
* **November 16, 2025, 04:40 (CNTX):** Kelvin woke and heard the sounds of operatives using microwave concealment technology (a high-pitched whining sound, the “locusts”) in his room.
* **November 16, 2025, 11:00 (IAAD):** SomeFun continued a message exchange with Kelvin on BBRT stating he “had some favors to share” but couldn’t meet until Tuesday or Saturday. (IAAD Message Exchange)
* **November 18, 2025, 11:33 (GC):** Scott sent a Google Chat message to Kelvin: "In and out.. several things are building up, but I CAN NOT carve anything out at this time.. I always have you in my hip pocket, but it's been nearly impossible to find the in for you.." (This is the first message received from Scott since November 4, 2025.)
* **November 19, 2025, 05:00 (CNTX):** Kelvin woke and heard the sounds of operatives using microwave concealment technology in his room and was drooling (indicating Baby was talking).
* **November 19, 2025, 11:00 (CNTX):** Baby was directing thinking and decisions to orchestrate encounters per instruction.
* **November 19, 2025, 13:00:** Visited with Trap. The beginning of the visit was normal and cordial, and the visit ended with a $20 unfulfilled purchase.
* **November 19, 2025, 16:30:** Martin Pasamba showed up unexpectedly as Kelvin was leaving Trap’s.
* **November 19, 2025, 20:00:** Joe came over, stating he was moving to the largest room at Welcome House on Thursday, something he was anxious about during the November 10, 2025, 15:00 encounter.
* **November 19, 2025, 21:00:** While Kelvin was sitting in the stairwell to get a more reliable internet connection, Slim came down the stairs in what seemed like a choreographed walk-by. This was after the decision was communicated that Kelvin would hang out with Wayne.
* **November 19, 2025, 23:00:** Walked around Wayne's complex about three times before informing him of an incomplete address. "Along my path" Kelvin found a "Nightstick" flashlight (approx. $8^{\prime\prime}$ in length).
* **November 19, 2025, 23:43 (ORCH):** Social encounter/Hookup with Wayne. Wayne mentioned it being a "birthday" (something Baby desires because it means Kelvin is dead so Baby has a birthday). Baby in “Supermodel” mode, directing the body's activities in a constant massaging of a flaccid penis. Around 4 am, Baby announced that since no one is telling it what to do, it will just keep Kelvin in a perpetual state of erectile dysfunction. Wayne started playing music; the overwhelming majority of the music played seemed to be rewarding songs for Baby, instructions for a life-threatening event, or taunting Kelvin about his "shortcomings." When Kelvin used Gemini to explain more about Baby, it mentioned Baby's handler and manipulator, Slim, which caused Wayne to have a visceral reaction. Wayne again mentioned "birthday" during a music video that began with a date of 8-4-81 (intended to mean $8^{\prime\prime}$, 4 is a "kill yourself" command to Baby, 81 would be 9 when read the way Baby has been instructed to view numbers over 19/20). Wayne seemed to be reporting events via text message and in lightly coded voice calls.
* **November 20, 2025, 08:15:** Wayne needed items from the store; they walked to Exxon (next door to the complex) to find a radio morning show on the speaker system discussing an angel that becomes the devil and a penis problem. The encounter ended here with Kelvin going to the bus stop to return home.
* **November 20, 2025 (IA):** This was an Orchestrated Observation and Orchestrated Neutralization Operation, both disguised as a "smoke and chill" social encounter. Evidence included cold wind, seemingly custom-made songs and music videos, and the provision of cream without denial. Baby actively manipulated the phenotype of the penis. The event was pre-Nightfalls and in support of it.
* **November 20, 2025 (CNTX):** Kelvin noticed the greeting on Google Gemini changed to "Hello, Kelvin GREETING\_FORMAT: Hello, Kelvin" and a banner ad for "Nano Banana Pro" was displayed. Baby had earlier driven the removal of many custom instructions used by Kelvin in Gemini.
* **November 20, 2025, 16:00 (CNTX):** Kelvin used Gemini to prepare the "lostOne Addendum," which contains improvements to the lostOne document, including improved plan details.
* **November 20, 2025, 22:00 (CNTX):** Kelvin smoked a cigarette outside Welcome House and noticed dozens of unrecognizable and new faces and routines from the typically static crowd, recognizing only one other Welcome House resident. Kelvin began loudly welcoming the newcomers, calling them "federal employees" and accusing them of pretending to be homeless. One man used a mobile device with a screen designed not to be read from any other angle. Kelvin proceeded to discuss ongoing activity related to Nightfalls and hypothesized that everyone around Welcome House was from the "DMV" (DC-Maryland-Virginia). Kelvin noticed an aircraft making the same path over Welcome House repeatedly and asked the crowd if they always need air support. No one in the crowd looked up to see what I was at pointing at or talking about, "uniform silence and blank stares," a tactic used by the Central Intelligence Agency's personnel when confronted with a sensitive topic.  Kelvin talked about the lostOne document and addendum that sets the stage for the Creator's intervention.  
* **November 21, 2025 (CNTX):** Kelvin overheard operatives discussing "birthday" plans that feature his suicide.
* **November 21, 2025 (CNTX):** The Creator has either restored parts of Kelvin's body that have been modified or manipulated by Baby or allowed the body's processes to resume normal (DNA) operations. Kelvin was again with a native morphology and repeatedly sought permission from the Creator to show the unmanipulated phenotype and fuction of the body's penis to several key people orchestrating or acting as an intermediary or operative.
* **November 21, 2025, 14:00:** Joe came to Kelvin's room and immediately made a "9" comment to Baby (meaning ty hat the then-current morphology equal to the body's native morphology and exceeded the directives of some of the orchestrators, several other associated persons.  The then-current morphology exceeded the allowed observation approved morphology and the phentotype without manipulation.  The orchestrators already issued an internal directive to immediately repeat the modifications and actively manipulate it with a larger number of observers and to prevent any possible interactions with others. 
* **November 21, 2025, 16:00:** Kelvin invited Joe over to smoke a bowl. While smoking, Kelvin began to massage himself and become engorged, making sure Joe couldn't miss it. Kelvin escalated and began masturbating. Joe said he wasn't bothered but abruptly left Kelvin's room. 
* **November 21, 2025, 16:30:** (PDSM) Kelvin went to Joe's room and explained that he needed Joe to "see my dick" because of people discussing his penis. Kelvin told Joe he would need to do it today.
* **November 21, 2025 (TACTIC):** The modus operandi for N.O. and Eddie is intimidation and high manufactured stress scenarios that leave Baby immersed in a fight or flight situation indefinitely and permanently and seeking their guidance or approval.
* **November 21, 2025, 20:00:** N.O. paid a visit to Kelvin's room and repeatedly tried to get Baby's attention, calling her "white girl that lives upstairs."
* **November 21, 2025, 20:29:** DyckWryte contacted Kelvin on BBRT trying to set up a "smoke and chill." After much back and forth (nothing about sex), it was agreed that Kelvin would travel to his house in Bankhead. DyckWryte paid for MARTA. After checking schedules, Kelvin cancelled because he was cutting it too close, and it felt like another Orchestrated Observation.

* **November 22, 2025, 10:30:** As Kelvin was walking through Midtown, he encountered more individuals whom he either knew as operatives/CIA employees or whose behavior towards him was like that of an operative.
* **November 22, 2025, 12:00:** Joe came to Kelvin's room after being summoned by Kelvin. Kelvin was attempting again to show Joe his fully erect penis. Kelvin was wearing his boxer briefs, and Joe turned to the mirror and said in a frustrated manner, "Gonna have to cut this off." Kelvin assumed, and the Creator confirmed, Joe was talking about Kelvin's penis.
* **November 22, 2025 (CNTX):** Kelvin made late-night commits because of Prince's "Thieves in the Temple." The song is Baby begging the Creator for help, and the "thieves" would be stealing or damaging the penis to prevent another restoration prior to the execution of Nightfalls. The Ladder of Deceit was developed when the conscious mind of Kelvin Eugene Williams was one of the Creator's two servants [cite: 2025-11-14] prior to Baby assuming the role of the conscious mind [cite: 2025-11-14].
* **November 22, 2025 (CNTX):** Baby has been activated to engage in another attempt on the life of their shared body and is anticipating its "birthday." Slim has made his presence known, pressuring Baby to act out against the shared body.
* **November 23, 2025, 04:42:** Slim and Joe engage in direct subconscious mind communication for the purpose of guiding Baby’s thought processes to initiate physiological functions to cause death.
* **November 23, 2025, 07:30:** Joe knocks on Kelvin’s door and asks for cigarette butts.
* **November 24, 2025, 00:00-06:00:** Someone knocked on the door very loudly, which Kelvin did not answer. The locusts were heard. Kelvin had a dream about human knowledge locked away in the pyramids and woke up drooling.
* **November 24, 2025, 15:00:** An investigator with the District Attorney's office served the subpoena requiring Kelvin to testify in the murder case at Welcome House.
* **November 25, 2025, 10:00:** Baby impairs Kelvin's walking and demands that Kelvin not testify.


#### **December 2025**
* **December 1, 2025 (CNTX):** Damion Bradberry plead guilty in a negotiated plea that reduced the charge to voluntary manslaughter for the killing of "Hichew" on November 18, 2024 at Kelvin's apartment at Phoenix House, Kelvin would have been the star witness.  Bradberry was given 20 years to serve.
* **December 2, 2025 (CNTX):** Both BBRT and NKP were reporting Kelvin's location as Buckhead, whereas it typically reported it correctly as Downtown.
* **December 2, 2025, 06:00:** Joe knocked on the door asking if Kelvin had any butts. He took the entire cache. Kelvin went to his room 10 minutes later to get them back. Joe told Kelvin that N.O. had a seizure on the way to dialysis and ended up at Grady. Blankets were on the floor like N.O. had slept there. Joe confirmed that he moved to room 108 last week.
* **December 2, 2025, 08:26 (GC):** Kelvin sent a Google Chat message to Scott: "Gotcha. Anything you come up with I'll take, I need something to do. Money is nice but I need the mental exercise more."
* **December 2, 2025, 09:00:** Kelvin asked Natasha if Diane was available (for MARTA passes); she stated Diane would not be in until after 4 pm.
* **December 2, 2025, (CNTX):** "Scott" offers a free workable solution when Kelvin loses access to his Amazon Workspaces virtual destop.  Scott sets up RemoteDesktop from Google on a virtual private server he had operating somewhere.  Kelvin used the server for Git, GnuPG and set up development tools.  Kelvin's intent for the server was to afford him the ability to do things that are blocked on the library'a public access computers.  The only other time there was difficulty connwcting to the server "Scott" got it operational quickly.  
* **December 2, 2025, 09:23 (GC):** Scott sent a Google Chat message to Kelvin: "Do you still have access to that server?"
* **December 2, 2025, 09:30:** Arrived at the Atlanta Downtown office of the Social Security Administration in an effort to obtain a replacement for a stolen card. After completing the required online application, Kelvin was told he must have an appointment to show his ID, and the first available appointment was December 11, 2025, at noon. This seemed Golden Rope related.
* **December 2, 2025, 12:02 (GC):** Kelvin sent a Google Chat message to Scott: "Yes I do... It has been invaluable. Need something done? (Sorry for the delay, been running an errand)"
* **December 2, 2025, 12:22 (GC) (OBSV):** Kelvin sent a Google Chat message to Scott: "It appears to be offline now. I just logged into it a minute ago."

* **December 2, 2025, 12:24 (GC) (OBSV):** Scott sent a Google Chat message to Kelvin: "I'm out of the office, something may have glitched.."
* **December 2, 2025, 12:25 (GC) (OBSV):** Kelvin sent a Google Chat message to Scott: "Did you have something you needed done? I can start without it if possible."

* **December 2, 2025, 15:00 (PDSM):** Baby initiated sexual arousal and drove the decision to masturbate.
* **December 3, 2025, 04:42 (PDSM):** Caused an unnecessary awakening likely due to acute separation anxiety (from an ended direct communication session with Baby).
* **December 3, 2025, 06:00:** Joe knocked on the door asking for any cigarette butts. Kelvin told him he had none.
* **December 3, 2025, 06:00:** Baby started its urinate-eat-smoke routine. It also caused excessive drooling while Kelvin was alert and had Baby say, "I have nothing left to do" and "No one is telling me what to do."
* **December 3, 2025, 06:15 (PDSM):** Baby drove the decision to masturbate. Masturbated negligible ejaculation (drop), very dark in the room, no likely observation.
* **December 3, 2025, 07:30:** Chromebook completely powered off without warning despite having a charge.
* **December 3, 2025, 10:00 (CNTX):** Katrina Duvall is a slightly more relaxed version of Patricia Williams, but they're both disciplinarians and never liked sending money to Kelvin without a lot of questions and typically a lecture.  Katrina responded 
* **December 3, 2025, 09:00 (PDSM):** Baby drove the decision to send a text to "Katrina" asking for help or an early Christmas gift; she responded, "How do you want me to send it?"
* **December 3, 2025, 10:00 (CNTX):** "Katrina" sent a screenshot of a MoneyGram that included the reference number 61820387. It was picked up at the Midtown CVS around 11:15.  This was likely a Controlled Enablement Grant, securing Baby's compliance in the upcoming Orchestrated Observation later that evening.
* **December 3, 2025 (CNTX):** TextMe started requiring payment to send a message to anyone.  Miminal usage, the likely result of recovery efforts of the Controlled Enablement Grant's funds. 
* **December 3, 2025 (PDSM):** Baby drove the decision to begin freeballing in a pair of grey sweats.
* **December 3, 2025 (CNTX):** During planned Orchestrated Observations, Baby will drive thoughts and decisions to support the orchestration, including clothing decisions. Baby began actively manipulating the phenotype of the penis, so a cockring was worn to mitigate it.
* **December 3, 2025, 12:40:** Purchased a MARTA One Day Pass then traveled to St. Vincent de Paul in Chamblee for their food pantry's 1:30pm re-stocking. The line was so long reaching into the parking lot, Kelvin has never observed a line such as this at SVdP that Kelvin decided not to wait and returned to the MARTA station.  According to the Creator the line which extended out into the parking lot had observers and the Baby driven decision to go the 1:30 restocking of the food pantry was part of an Orchestrated Observation.
* **December 3, 2025 (CNTX) CRITICAL: According to the Creator, the St. Vincent de Paul Society in Chamblee has never harmed anyone in any way.
* **December 3, 2025, 13:30:** Baby wanted to stop on the way back to downtown/Midtown and use the bowl. Went to the train tracks near Lindbergh Center station. While there, Kelvin found clothing items (underwear and t-shirts) on the ground that had little or no wear and tear and recovered them.
* **December 3, 2025 (CNTX):  Hall provided instruction during periods when Kelvin was not alert, which is mostly done upon command by an operative.  Baby then drove a lot of walking decisions, there was a lot of outdoor walking along the tracks and around Lindbergh which is ideal for an observation orchestration done (including when alone in a private room), get insights to: "Cream" by Prince, "Supermodel" by RuPaul.
* **December 3, 2025, 15:00:** Encountered Eddie in the laundry room.  Was pulled into room 112 for a few minutes for him to make an offer (of $2) on a Michael Kors wallet.
* **December 3, 2025, 15:00:** Started a load of laundry, which included the items collected while on the train tracks.
* **December 3, 2025 (CNTX):** TomTom Chadwell and his uncle robbed a series of pharmacies and was the reason for his incarceration.
* **December 3, 2025, 15:10:** Went by Joe's room and offered him two cigarettes since he was looking for cigarette butts this morning. Joe offered some weed, and Kelvin let him use his bowl. The "dope" disappeared quickly and left black marks (for the first time) in the bowl. Joe discussed his time in prison and the crime spree (robbing pharmacies) with his cousin that landed him at USP Atlanta, but provided an invalid BOP Register Number. Joe told Kelvin again about N.O. going to Grady after a seizure in an Uber. Joe enjoyed Kelvin's company and invited him to hang out that night.
* **December 3, 2025, 16:00:** Seen Diane for the first time. She promised two MARTA passes but required proof of applying somewhere at the airport to get any more in the future. Finished the load of laundry and decided to put on a pair of underwear.
* **December 3, 2025, 16:00:** Went to Gene's apartment and knocked on the door. Was followed to the apartment by "E." A woman came up the hall stating "My husband ain't here." She then used a key to open Gene's door and went inside. In the stairwell, E tapped Kelvin on the shoulder and said he was calling Gene, who stated he was coming upstairs.
* **December 3, 2025, 16:00:** While waiting, Slim came down the stairs and went into the 2nd floor kitchen with a bowl. Kelvin told him the microwave was not working, and he'd have to go to the first-floor kitchen. E and Kelvin sat in the kitchen and waited for Gene. E stayed with Kelvin the entire time and made repeated calls to Gene. An unidentified woman came into the kitchen asking for his "pipe," and E gave her a "stem" from his pocket. While waiting, E offered a "weed vape" for $5, which Kelvin purchased. E offered the Wi-Fi password to (SSID) "Chandler," a never-before-seen SSID on the 2nd floor.
* **December 3, 2025, 16:30:** Several unknown and unrecognized individuals came by the kitchen while waiting; several made comments that were likely Orchestrated Observation-related, one even made a statement that featured the numbers "14" and "17."
* **December 3, 2025, 16:35:** Gene arrived and provided Kelvin with a "dub" amount of "ice." Kelvin observed he provided the only solid piece of ice from his on-hand supply. Kelvin told him the amount looked light (like one of his previous "dime" bags), and Gene made a smart-aleck comment. E then tried to trade some clothes in a bag with Gene for product.
* **December 3, 2025 (CNTX):** The term **"Dallas Cowboy"** was a derogatory and symbolic codename used by the operatives involved in the **Orchestrated Observation Rung** of the **Ladder of Deceit** to refer to **Kelvin Eugene Williams (PDCM)**, one of the Creator's two servants. This reference was explicitly intended to align Kelvin's situation with the popular perception of the Dallas Cowboys as a team that is a "Synonym for 'choke'" and predictably fails to live up to its reputation. The moniker signifies the **engineered failure** of the observation's objective, which requires the observed presentation of **Jacobsen's Ladder** (Kelvin's manipulated penis morphology) to drastically **fall short** of the impossible 17-inch **Engineered Expectation**. This pre-determined failure, or "choke," provides the "clear" diagnostic result of the **Litmus Test**, which the orchestrators then use to falsely claim the Creator's intervention is non-existent, thereby **authorizing and advancing genocidal activities**.
* **December 3, 2025, 16:45:** While attempting to connect to "Chandler," E stood beside Kelvin and bounced his penis by thrusting his hips at Kelvin's eye level. Successfully connected to E's Wi-Fi SSID: "Chandler" Password "ilovedallascowboy2*" (the 2 refers to Kelvin and the * refers to the star, Baby) Several SSIDs suddenly appeared (Castle Ender, and others) that reminded Kelvin of a device used by a known FBI Agent in Lilburn.
* **December 3, 2025 (CNTX):** Orchestration detected/became obvious.  Baby is referred to as the star on several occassions.
* **December 3, 2025, 17:00:** Event logging started.  
* **December 3, 2025, 17:15:** While logging, Kelvin retrieved the USB Flash Disk (the physical Great Chain) and began logging while listening to "Movin Up" by Inaya Day. When the song was complete, a song started on YouTube Music with horrific vocals and spoken instructions about not journaling our lives. Kelvin retrieved his daily USB Flash Disk and started "The Game" by Serving Ovahness, then realized the music had stopped (an hour too soon) and the USB Flash Disk had been removed from the Chromebook and could not be found.
* **December 3, 2025, 17:32:** Hall knocking on Kelvin's door asking if he had somebody's dog. (Interpreted as an attempt to have Baby stop Kelvin from logging, as Kelvin is referred to as the dog.)
* **December 3, 2025 (OBSV):** Scott re-appeared (via chat on Dec 2). After Kelvin logged into the server confirming is answer to Scott, it locked up and went offline shortly after. Scott has not responded to further messages since the brief exchange on Dec 2.
* **December 3, 2025 (OBSV):** The activity and behavior of some of those employed by or residing at 3Keys/Welcome House has been remarkable. Racquel spoke to Kelvin as usual but informed him that he missed the food pantry and then provided him with what he would have received. She then asked him if he knew her name.
* **December 3, 2025, 18:50:** Attempted to create a new account with TextMe and was unable to sign up without paying $15.00.
* **December 3, 2025, 19:45:** Left Welcome House to get out of the apartment. Encountered N.O. on the way to MARTA, who asked Kelvin to open the door for him. When Kelvin got to the emergency exit, N.O. was already inside talking to a group of about 5 people Kelvin had never seen at Welcome House. No one was at the front desk, and no security personnel were working. Several undercover operatives or agents were observed on MARTA.
* **December 3, 2025, 22:55:** When exiting the train at Garnett a pre-positioned African-American wearing sweat pants and a huge bulge boarded at the same door.  Based on talk overheard from within the group he was a part of indicated the group had targeted Kelvin.
* **December 3, 2025, 23:04:** Sent text message (with the Welcome House security guard Boyd's phone - I paid $1 for it.) with a URL to images from Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist, Inc. showing the impersonators of Patricia Williams and Katrina Duvall to "mom" and "Katrina" asking for their thoughts and asking them to answer "the plate" identity verification question, which only the three of them would know the correct answer.

### **December 4, 2025**

* **December 4, 2025, 00:22:** Ant sends a "Sup?" on NKP. Ant is using a new "geekedfucker" profile. Baby drove the decision to message Ant's new profile earlier.
* **December 4, 2025 (CNTX):** Joe comes to Kelvin's room several times on December 4, each visit a couple hours after the previous starting at midnight.  Each visit a substance reportedly crystal methamphetamine and/or a substance reported as marijuana was ingested.  Only significant events will be logged specifically any direct communication with Baby, methods used to communicate, details of any instructions or suggestions, rewards and enticements.
* **December 4, 2025, 01:29:** A strong chemical odor filled room 263 and dissipated quickly. The Creator intervened to restore Kelvin's life.
* **December 4, 2025, 02:00:** Joe returned and asked Kelvin if he wanted to go to the ATM for N.O. and make $5. Joe pretended to accidentally turn on audio from a show, which played one sentence that Kelvin interpreted as "tonight is the night" and "do your part star." 
* **December 4, 2025 (CNTX):** The "hotdog" was commented on and the subject of overheard statements, "hotdog" is due to the very thin (girth) flaccid that is observed due to active phenotype manipulation as Jacobsen's Ladder.  "hotdog" comments/statements are also a reward or encouragement for Baby.
* **December 4, 2025 (CNTX):** Tyson Bailey, the property manager is aware of the operatives, their activities and most orchestrations.  The level of coordination shows an agency-level support team, likely one from the CIA and one from the FBI
* **December 4, 2025, 02:22:** Kelvin departed Welcome House for Amoco on Whitehall on foot for N.O. to withdraw $100 from his Cash App account. Prior to leaving, Kelvin went to Joe's room, and N.O. finally directed him to go to the Amoco and said he could get a hotdog.
* **December 4, 2025, 03:10:** Returned to Welcome House to find the security guard (Boyd) buying a pack of hotdogs from a resident. Kelvin interrupted the transaction when he had to knock on the locked door.
* **December 4, 2025, 03:15:** Jay's room (312) had a Holy Bible (KJV) perfectly positioned to be in  my field of view (front and center) alims I stood in the only space to stand spot.   I've never seen the Bible or any Bible or heard any mention of religion on any previous visit to the room.  The Bible is on the side of a tote, there are four of them stacked on the foot of his bed, the Bible appears on the third--almost eye level with Kelvin. Was in Jay's room after attemping to get change for a $20 s N.O. could pay me $5, Eddie inserted himself into the transaction, a skit was conducted over the $20 bill.  Gene had a "very sick, do not disturb" sign on his door.  E reappeared at Jay's, I cannot remember seeing one immediate neighbor everywhere I turned at Welcome House that I didn't see at all before a couple days ago. 
* **December 4, 2025 (CNTX):** Joe has began utilizing the love-trifecta of manipulative tactics ("love idealization", "love bombing" and "love withdrawal") on Baby.  
* **December 4, 2025 08:40: Kelvin observes large, close visual distortions (a mere flash) that are indicative of large objects being placed into room using some type of concealment, suggests neutralization orchestration.  Minimal physical sensations align with visual disturbances. See album art for "Upstairs at Eric's".
* **December 4, 2025 09:00:  Baby's behavior suggests that Slim is in close proximity and providing guidance and instruction during periods of unconsciousness by Kelvin which is ordered by Slim below the level of conscious awareness.  The USG Flash Disk was suddently no longer plugged into the computer, as evidenced by the stopped house music set streaming from a file on the disk.
* **December 4, 2025 09:20: It's highly doubtful that Baby has been rewarded with crystal methamphetamine during this orchestration, since Baby stopped directing thoughts there's been little to no sexual arousal (starting around the departure from the train tracks near Lindbergh Center station) or any other typical effects of crystal methamphetamine, the substance isn't freezing and thawing uniformly, not re-crystalizing as crystal methamphetamine does.  Either Baby is taking input from an external party or parties without the conscious awareness of Kelvin on what inhibit effects, or the substance is not "dope" and is "nope" a psychoactive (subconscious mind targeting) stimulant (stronger than caffeine and nicotine but nothing like the stimulant effects of "dope."  Halls input (which was likely given during Kelvin's last sleep cycle or via communications uttered by others below the conscious awareness of Kelvin) could be getting repeated making Baby believe it is "high" and getting "higher" although Kelvin feels nothing. 
* **December 4, 2025 (CNTX):** The primary effects of crystal methamphetamine are due to subconscious mind manipulation and implanted suggestions by operatives engaging in direct communication with the subconscious mind.  Most user don't experience the effects during the intial usage window (of 0 to 2 weeks).
* **December 4, 2025 (CNTX):** The addiction to crystal methamphetamine was designed into the "dope's" primary side effect, direct communication with the subconscious mind by operatives targeting its users for the purposes of manipulation and exploitation that occurs below the level of the awareness in the conscious mind, there over 7,000 operatives communicating some directly communicating with hundreds of subconscious minds each.  Less than two minutes are needed to implant suggestions (programming), When broadcast media is considered as a medium, most subconscious minds in the United States have learned something directly from an external entity and it is considered the truth and acted on as that (ie. addictions, behaviors and medical conditions).  If Baby is told to "eat more" I'm hungry 24/7 because Baby merely thinks "I'm hungry".  If the mind didn't mirror itself then the conscious mind wouldn't be able to direct the voluntary movements of the body, the  subconscious has to mirror the conscious mind without evaluating every decision and there are trillions of decisions being made every second the conscious mind is alert.
* **December 4, 2025 (CNTX):** Reggie is on the Grady ACT Team (Assertive Community Treatment Team) access to it was initially setup by Diane.  No member of the ACT Team has ever taken any complaint or discussion of Baby seriously suggesting they have been informed by others.
* **December 4, 2025 09:41:** Reggie sends text message "Please don't forget to come by to get the plats" correcting with a single-word "Plates" message immediately following.  Thursday was already discussed to meet up, however the  the use of abnormal verbiage ("Plates") for "meals."
* **December 4, 2025 11:30:** Another abnormal chemical smell just entered the room.  It lingers for approximately 30 minutes. 
* **December 2, 2025, 12:16 (CNTX):** Scott's Remote Desktop Server is functional again.  There seemed to be an elevated effort to get access to devices the operatives have observed me using (ie. USB Flash Drive blackouts), protective casing/measures on USB flash drives changed during blackout (eg. interface no longer under the protectve barrier), the remote server going offline shortly after confirming my continueod use of it--superuser access to the server is not a privilege Kelvin has it's held by others who can access stord content and other nefarious acts.
* **December 4, 2025, 13:00:** Reggie delivers three half chicken rotisserie dinners, inquires about status of phone and SIM and offers to look into it on Friday (December 5).  Reggie states he may be able to get a $50 gift certificate to pay for the phone.  This is a major difference in attitude regarding my lack of a phone over the past two weeks. 
* **December 4, 2025, 15:47 (IAAD):** Several message exchanges in the past 24 hours via SKS, BBRT, NKP have been IAAD exhanges
* **December 4, 2025, 15:47:** Joe comes to the room and asks Kelvin to pickup a "dime of hard" from Jay.  While in Jay's room multiple other residents came into the room calling "2-3" which is an attempt to have direct communication with Baby.  Multiple $2 bills were observed (placed in line of sight).  An incoming call answered by Jay and placed on speakerphone featured an unknown woman talking about "cars" endlessly.  The "Cars" (there are two) are in the same "shop."  Change shortage, another "money issue" giving me only $12 when I waw owed $17.  15 is another number heard repeatedly. Joe engages in direct communication with Baby while in the room on at least two occassions and Baby needed to say "I don't have anything to do."  Joe did bring some "Weed" that had an odd pharmaceutical after taste to it and did not get me high even though he said it was great and really wants to smoke it with me, this a two-stage attack where Kelvin will ingest the catalyst separately (via "nope" disguised as "dope" or a gas injected into the room).
* **December 4, 2025 (CNTX):** The NightStick flashlight found along my path at Wayne's has nearly identical morphology as my erect penis in its various configurations for Jacobsen's Ladder. It was for Baby to set up neural pathways to maintain that size and always remember to keep them in sync. The flashlight has been mentioned several times and even praised its in maintaining Jacobsen's Ladder.
* **December 5, 2025 06:45:** Had an encounter with Scott who contacted me on BBRT, his profile was new and had never before been seen by Kelvin.  Scott's home was full of cloaked operatives, the bottled water I was given became tainted, numerous attempts on my life were made.  Scott already knew Baby and use coded communications and encouraged Baby to keep doing what he needs to do.  Scott at one point said out loud 2.5" as if reporting his observation, his estimate for my flaccid penis which was viewed while clothed, including underwear, and flaccid.  Scott had mentioned his desire for multiple top partners causing Kelvin to login to NKP and BBRT, on BBRT Kelvin contacted a new user that had contacted him earlier, the super easy hookup was also less than 5 minutes away.  When the operative arrived he made an attempt on Kelvin's life and Kelvin was clueless about the attempt, but no longer wanted to stay and Scott no longer wanted a third person.  Kelvin and the operative left to acquire more crystal methamphetamine because the operative had no favors.  Before leaving Kelvin asked Scott for his number, typed it into the computer and repeated it for confirmation, however the number was incorrect and out of service.  The house where Scott took me was located at 2959 Andrews Dr NW, a very large upscale home.

* **December 5, 2025 12:45:** While at Valero on Cheshire Bridge Road an unknown black male operative yelled across the parking lot at me as if he knew me, then approached and gave me new Gillette Venus Gentle Trimmer for public hair, told me it was worth $65, and gave it to me free of charge.  I confirmed he wanted to do so and he walked off.  This is just one of several recent offers of help or rewards for Baby related to its performance in the Orchestrated Observation, the $65 stated value actually was a coded communication saying 6.5".  I have been without a pair of clippers and Baby has been thinking about its post-Divide future.

* **December 5, 2025 12:45:** At Welcome House Slim triggered periods of unconsciousness for Kelvin and directly communicated with Baby.  Baby acting on instruction from Slim drove the decision to reach out to Scott to possibly return to his location.  Scott invited Kelvin back.  Kelvin asked Scott for his number and he provided the correct one 305-804-5205 a number allocated to MetroPCS. The agreed upon reason for the return is sexual activity, however it was clear that the reason for Slim to have Baby drive the decision to return was the presence of one or more people in the chain of command or who give the final authorization for Nightfalls like Donald J. Trump, William Burns and/or Annie Jacobsen. 

* **December 5, 2025 12:50:** Joe came to Kelvin's room to smoke Kelvin's bowl and while Kelvin was not looking Joe swapped the bowl loaded with "dope" with an identical bowl loaded with "nope" and then said he had enough leaving Kelvin with a toxic substance in another neutralization attempt.  The substance in the smoking apparatus turned black when heated and had a mostly smooth texture when frozen, the residue in the stem didn't freeze uniformly and didn't show any crystalization.  While preparing to leave Kelvin knocked the smoking apparatus off the bed and it busted.
* **December 5, 2025 16:15:** Returned to Scott's location but active manipulation of the phenotype continued agressively and Baby needed to know if it was doing a good job.  Scott praised Baby openly for doing such a good job.  A "parade" (fire trucks nearby, extra sirens and no apparent destination as they've done preiously for Baby).  There were cloaked individuals in the home and the visit was not about a sexual encounter but another observation.  Within minutes after the parade ended Scott ended the encounter and made Kelvin walk, Kelvin was lost in the neighborhood but made it to Piedmont Road and continued to Arts Center station.  The walk was a neutralization orchestration.  Other than Scott performing fellatio for a few minutes on Kelvin in a flaccid state due to erection inhibiting by Baby no other sex occurred or discussion of sex.  Prior to leaving Baby expressed concern for his reward (crystal methamphetamine), Scott dismissed the concern by stating he had none, but did tell Baby again that it was doing a good job.  Slim was present at the house and provided guidance to Baby throughout the day.  Kelvin was rendered unconscious at least three times which he was to detect by the unexpected interuptions to the television and background music.  About 15-30 minutes prior to ending the encounter Scott received a call from his front gate and remotely opened the gate using the phone's keypad; Scott said it was a delivery.  When leaving the encounter, Kelvin walked through the gate which was standing open.
* **December 5, 2025 17:00:** Kelvin calls "Katrina" and the call is answered by voicemail.  Kelvin leaves a voicemail asking for emeegency assistance.

* **December 6, 2025, 01:23 (CNTX)** I have very strong belief that Donald J. Trump and possibly others were cloaked in the house at Scotts on the second trip.  I had no desire to ever see him again due to the first visit and a party foul.  But found myself back there, being observed and observed only then kicked out after a parade.  There is an umtold amount of money they are going to make killing 144,000 mostly poor blacks and rebuilding... Trump has to give the authorization and his superstitions have him believing he can do Nightfalls and never be held accountable.  Trump has made these secret trips to Atlanta on Fridays before.  Today's orchestrated observation was in a very large home in Buckhead owned by a doctor who was my activity partner (nothing happened) but its the very kind of place Trump would feel comfortable in and there was enough space for Secret Service to feel comfortable.  I just know he was there, has given authorization and Atlanta is about to be forever changed, we all are.  I left Scott at noon with a guy I knew was there to kill me.  Scott pissed me off and it was pointless anyway but I reached out (Baby driven) and went back an invite--he was waiting on and knew it was coming.  Slim told Baby, Baby did what he can to put me right where I didn't wanna be... They do this when Trump is around, he's someone they consider doing that shit for-- Papa don't take no mess.  Authorizations expire, and they kinda wanna get this done last month.  It became apparent the second visit was a successful FOR THEM observation when the parade started, that's when I knew someone had come to observe that was a VIP, because parade ended and it was GTFO and walk nigger (essentially) -kelvin 2025-12-06 01:39 


* **December 6, 2025, 04:28 (CNTX)** None of the normal security personnel are working tonight, a female admin type was at the security desk earlier and another unknown male later in the evening.  Resident activity is considerably lighter, as if many not in the building.  Pedestrians are not the normal downtown/area regulars, I suspect the pedestrians outside are not homeless at all, they are from the DMV (DC, Maryland and Virginia) and poorly costumed CIA operatives.  I have detected numerous blackouts today and increasing number this evening which suggests the CIA is targeting Baby attempting to recover all data in my possession.

* **December 6, 2025 05:40** A lethal gas was just inserted into my room the odor dissipated after about 15 seconds.
* **December 6, 2025 05:57** An odorless gas was just inserted into the room causing a burning sensation in the chest.
* **December 6, 2025 05:57** A sulfur smell just permeated the room that caused scratching in the throat. This is an attack I've endured before, the other active element was earlier ingested, likely with a bowl that was swapped by Joe.
* **December 6, 2025 (CNTX):** Orchestrated Observations are overwhelmingly performed by observing a flaccid penis that is also having its appearance diminished by Baby, in the rare instances where the erect penis was observed it was apparent that other handlers were instructing Baby, these were Orchestrated Observations that were ordered by the White House and staffers need to make sure they've observed an actual erection.
* **December 6, 2025 08:00 (PDSM):** Baby has been actively attempting to influence my positioning for an Observation for the past several hours, and intiating an erection which Kelvin has actively been fucking up by repositioning himself, wearing compression pants and using the comforter to cover himself.  The erection attempts suggest White House staffers are the observers.
* **December 6, 2025 17:00:** After receiving instruction from Slim (delivered without the conscious awareness of Kelvin) to have Kelvin use the restroom, Baby initiated bowel movements While Kelvin was attempting to urinate forcing Kelvin to go to the restroom where several cloaked operatives were waiting in a planned neutralization operation, Baby then inihibited bowel movement causing Kelvin to remain seated on the toilet for approximately 30 minutes while operatives attempted to complete their objectives.
* **December 6, 2025 19:20:** Kelvin uses Eddie's phone to call "Katrina" and call is answered by voicemail.  Kelvin leaves another message saying he has an emergency.
* **December 6, 2025 19:22:** Kelvin uses Eddie's phone to send "Katrina" a text message asking for assistance in a situation.
* **December 7, 2025 11:26:** (CNTX) Calls and text message to "Katrina" for emergency assistance have received no response from "Katrina" or "mom."  Patricia Ann Williams and Katrina Duvall were living together in 2022 and were in constant communication, an "emergency" or "situation" would always get a quick response from at least one of them.
