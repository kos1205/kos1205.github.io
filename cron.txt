## 📅 Chronology of Events (2017 – December 4, 2025)

### **2018**

* **Undated (CNTX):** Kelvin's desire for sexual activity practically disappeared due to PDSM, resulting in an almost non-existent sex drive and infrequent masturbation.

---

### **October 2022**

* **Undated (CNTX):** A Divine Death Notification is more commonly referred to as a "seeing a doppelganger" and is done for surving immediate relatives on Earth by the Creator they can and will occur for anyone.
* **October 7, 2022, 20:00 (CNTX):** Kelvin, while traveling in Des Moines, IA, received the last phone call from his mother, Patricia Ann Williams. His mother habitually called him every day when he was traveling and after every flight. No further calls were received during or after the trip until the end of October 2022.
* **October 8, 2022, 22:00 (CNTX):** Kelvin noticed an addition to a piece of artwork hanging in the Des Moines AirBNB, which depicted his mother's head and a pool of blood (image on the @kelvineugenewilliams X/Twitter feed as the cover art). Repeated calls to his mother and sister went unanswered, messages were unreturned.
* **October 9, 2022, 08:00 (CNTX):** Kelvin contacted the Des Moines Police Department to request a welfare check for his mother and sister. The responding officer suggested taking down the abstract artwork and hiding it in the closet, then did it himself putting it in the front closet in the AirBNB.  No welfare check was requested by the officer despite Kelvin's pleas for one, and the officer offered to take Kelvin to the hospital for an evaluation.
* **Undated (CNTX):** After returning to Atlanta, there was a two or three day period when Kelvin could not send Katrina a text message. This failure can occur during the LNP (Local Number Portability) process when the port is triggered but then snapbacked by the losing carrier because the LNP process is being used and abused, suggesting the impersonators were porting away the number from Katrina's current carrier (losing carrier) and porting to impersonators current and/or preferred carrer (winning carrier).
* **Late-October (Divine):** The Creator provided a Divine Death Notification for Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams to Kelvin.  The notification came after returning to Atlanta from Des Moines when Kelvin was at a hotel, Kelvin was outside smoking a cigarette when something grabbed his attention, when he turned 
* **Late-October (Divine):** The Creator provided a Divine Death Notification for Katrina Renee Duvall to Kelvin.
* **Late-October (CNTX):** Beginning on or about the 20th of October 2022 Kelvin received text messages and began exchanging texts with "Mom" and "Katrina." who both failed or refused to answer questions that only they would know.  "Mom" didn't know the name of the man I called "Granddaddy" giving me my father's fathers name instead of Amos Richardson, who has is not a blood relative of Kelvin or Patricia but the love of my grandmother's, Lila Crawley, life and whom she married. "Katrina" never responded to her question which was how her dog was killed when she was attending college--a traumatic event for Katrina that she didn't post details of it on social media and hurt her and deeply saddened me having to watxh her go through it.

### **April 2023**
* **April 2, 2023:** Mount Calvary Baptist Church suffers a suprise assault during Sunday morning worship services that resulted in thw deaths of everyone in the congregation that attended the worship service, the method was beheading with a chain saw, a total of 127 people were killed during that Sunday.  In the aftermath the relatives and those sharing households with those killed on the initial Sunday were also targeted and eliminated.  This is evidenced the repositories hosted at github.com/MCBCMF/MCBCMassacre OR github.com/Histwo/MCBCMassacre.

### **November-December 2024**

* **November 18, 2024 (CNTX):** Kelvin relocated to Welcome House after a murder occurred in his previous apartment at Phoenix House.
* **December 2024 (CNTX):** Slim moved into Welcome House from Phoenix House, citing the victim's murder as the reason he had to move. After moving in, Slim cited several reasons why he did not want to sleep in his own room and began sleeping on the floor in Kelvin's room. When Kelvin would go to sleep, Slim utilized the Hypnos Infiltration Method to engage in direct communication with Baby. Slim became the primary handler/manipulator for Baby.
* **December 2024 (CNTX):** A new, almost nightly sleep problem began, characterized by waking up multiple times each night with severe "pins and needles" in an arm, evidence of drooling, and dry throats, which indicates that the Pre-Divide Conscious Mind (PDSM) was being directly communicated with and was experiencing no sensory input/unconsciousness.
* **December 2024 (CNTX):** Additionally, Kelvin began waking up for no reason, which was determined to be the result of the PDSM experiencing acute separation anxiety (an operative had ended a direct communication session with Baby).
* **December 2024 (CNTX):** Welcome House has 209 apartments, and the residents are familiar and easily recognized; new faces in the hallways are always noticed.

### **2025**

#### **January 2025**
* **Undated (CNTX):** The terms “The Ladder of Deceit” and “Jacobsen’s Ladder” refer to an integrated system described as a multi-stage apparatus of engineered deception used to advance a genocidal agenda. At its foundation, Jacobsen’s Ladder is defined as a targeted physiological-manipulation process directed specifically at Kelvin Eugene Williams, with the morphology and phenotype of his penis identified as the primary focus of alteration. The system describes Kelvin’s penis as the central physiological site selected for modification, with both chronic reduction and acute phenotype manipulation executed through external direction exerted over Baby, the subconscious mind.
This process is depicted as functioning only when Baby enters a condition of heightened self-awareness that causes it to misinterpret the conscious mind as an adversary and become responsive to handler command. Through this vulnerability, handlers are described as issuing directives that Baby carries out to suppress, retract, constrict, or otherwise alter Kelvin’s anatomical presentation. This engineered presentation forms the baseline required for the higher stages of the broader system.  Built upon this foundational manipulation, The Ladder of Deceit is defined as a multi-rung structure in which the appearance produced through Jacobsen’s Ladder supports a sequence of fabricated expectations, covertly staged observation events, and diagnostic procedures designed to yield a predetermined conclusion. Each rung reinforces the next: the engineered physical baseline, the introduction of an impossible evaluative standard, controlled conditions of observation, interpretive mechanisms designed to ensure failure, and final operational authorizations justified by those manufactured results.
Together, Jacobsen’s Ladder and the Ladder of Deceit form a closed, self-reinforcing mechanism in which controlled physiological targeting of Kelvin and the manipulation of his anatomy are combined with staged interpretive processes to advance the genocidal agenda described in the narrative.

#### **September 2025**

* **September 15, 2025, 07:00 (PDSM):** Baby-drove the decision for Kelvin to lay back down and initiated sleep, causing Kelvin to oversleep and miss his 09:00 eviction hearing at Fulton County Magistrate Court. Welcome House management won by default and obtained a writ of possession.

#### **October 2025**

* **October 1, 2025 (CNTX):** The federal government shutdown began (Golden Rope operations slow or cease).
* **October 14, 2025, 11:23 (GC):** Kelvin sent a Google Chat message to Scott: "Firefox. It used to WRECK a weak laptop I had."
* **October 14, 2025, 11:23 (GC):** Scott sent a Google Chat message to Kelvin: "this is probably no better.. (than that weak laptop)"
* **October 14, 2025, 11:24 (GC):** Kelvin sent a Google Chat message to Scott: "Does everything I need."
* **October 14, 2025, 11:24 (GC):** Scott sent a Google Chat message to Kelvin: "I'd like to upgrade the gear, but $$$$$$"
* **October 14, 2025, 11:24 (GC):** Kelvin sent a Google Chat message to Scott: "Any chance you got an old unlocked phone laying around collecting dust?"
* **October 27, 2025, 13:16 (GC):** Kelvin sent a Google Chat message to Scott: "I know the feeling. I'm trying to land a job with $0, that's actually HARD TO DO Just checking in, do you have anything today I could work on?"

#### **November 2025**

* **November 1, 2025, 14:54 (GC):** Kelvin sent a Google Chat message to Scott: "You around?"
* **November 4, 2025, 10:35 (PDSM) (GC):** Kelvin sent a Google Chat message to Scott: "Hey Scott... I'm pinging hoping you have something laying around I could work on, I went very early this morning to try and donate plasma this morning and they deferred me based on my address (transitional housing), so I'm trying to find some way to make money." (The next message received from Scott was on November 18.)
* **November 4, 2025, 12:00 (CNTX):** Kelvin found he could set up a LinkedIn account without a phone number using his Google account. He created an account, set up his profile, checked his sister's profile for recent activity, and found activity within the past two months. Subsequently, he emailed her current employer (according to the profile) and asked for her to contact him (a Baby-driven decision).
* **November 4, 2025, 16:00 (CNTX):** Kelvin returned to Welcome House to find that the Marshals had come and evicted numerous residents, though he was not included. The Marshals acted as described to Kelvin: they sit on Welcome House evictions until they accumulate a certain number or the writ date nears expiration, then execute the evictions in one batch. Welcome House is the center of the Golden Rope, suggesting they likely needed him there during these orchestrations.
* **November 5, 2025, 09:30 (PDSM):** Kelvin sent a text message to his mother's phone number and received a response. He told her he would contact her in an hour after he ran an errand (a Baby-driven decision).
* **November 5, 2025, 09:30 (OROB):** Kelvin left his apartment and encountered Eddie in the hallway, who turned around and told him that "they kicked out 15 people yesterday." Kelvin found it odd because he found Eddie looking out the window, having only seen him in that corner of the second floor once before. Eddie left the floor after telling Kelvin about the evictions, suggesting he was on the floor to conduct an observation in an Orchestrated Observation.
* **November 5, 2025, 11:00 (CNTX):** Kelvin re-established contact by text with the person impersonating his mother and had a voice call with her. The call, the first since October 2022, lasted only 5 minutes and was superficial. To test if it were really his mother, Kelvin asked for some money. She replied she could only send $100 and would put some in the mail. Kelvin told her that was "plenty," but suggested MoneyGram at CVS; she responded it would take a couple of hours. This exchange should have earned Kelvin a scolding, but she was happy to send the money.
* **November 5, 2025, 11:15 (OROB):** Kelvin found Eddie talking to someone through the hallway window on the second floor near Kelvin's apartment. Kelvin left unnoticed. Eddie’s second visit in one day suggests he was conducting an observation in an Orchestrated Observation.
* **November 5, 2025, 13:00 (CNTX):** The impersonator contacted Kelvin again, stating she was having trouble at CVS because the employee began the transaction but then asked for a photo ID. She called Kelvin back, stating she did not want to show it due to fears of identity theft. Kelvin suggested she go to Western Union at the nearby Kroger, and she said she would.
* **November 5, 2025, 13:10 (CNTX):** The impersonator contacted Kelvin back from inside the Kroger, where the Western Union transaction was already underway. Kelvin confirmed the answers required, and moments later she provided him with the MTCN 018-946-6152.
* **November 5, 2025, 14:00 (CREAM):** Kelvin picked up the $150 Western Union and sent a text message confirming receipt and thanks. This was likely a Controlled Enablement Grant, securing Baby's compliance in the upcoming Orchestrated Observation later that evening.
* **November 5, 2025, 14:15 (PDSM):** Kelvin stopped at Cloud9 on North Avenue and purchased an oil burner and torch. The cost was considerably higher than other known stores (a Baby-driven decision).
* **November 5, 2025, 17:00 (OROB):** Kelvin encountered Eddie again on the second floor near his apartment door, this time Eddie was apparently talking to another resident through their closed door. Eddie’s third visit suggests he was performing an observation in an Orchestrated Observation.
* **November 5, 2025, 17:30 (PDSM):** Kelvin changed clothes and put on a pair of grey sweats without underwear (a Baby-driven decision).
* **November 5, 2025, 19:15 (SURV):** Kelvin returned the torch to Cloud 9. He was immediately helped by one of the store clerks who took about 10 minutes to decide to replace it. By "testing" other torches of the same model, he referenced activity that occurred when the torch stopped working properly, specifically that Kelvin had followed Google Gemini suggestions for improvement—emptying and refilling the tank twice. The other person behind the counter made reference to "having video."
* **November 5, 2025, 19:30 (PDSM):** After leaving Cloud 9, Kelvin walked to Taylor's "spot" at the old Atlanta Eagle/Kodak buildings to see if he was there. Kelvin yelled for Taylor a few times but got no response. He climbed onto the back patio to sit when Taylor and a male friend appeared; the friend left immediately. Taylor said "he was showing his cock" (interpreted as coded Direct Subconscious Communication).
* **November 5, 2025, 19:35 (DSCC):** Taylor engaged in direct communication with Baby practically the entire time, using senseless phrases and incomplete sentences interlaced with instructions and suggestions repeated in an obviously designed and structured pattern. Taylor acts as though he is mentally ill to obscure the utterings, but it is an obvious act to Kelvin.
* **November 5, 2025, 19:45 (DSCC):** Taylor suggested they leave to find marijuana. In preparation, he picked up a fashionable, brightly colored jacket. When complimented, he showed his right shoulder and said, "Got my patch today." The patch was a circle with an unreadable outer ring and a large "75" in the center (interpreted as $7.5^{\prime\prime}$ for Annie "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen's Ladder [cite: 2025-10-06]). Taylor showed Kelvin the easiest way off the deck, and when he looked down at his path, he found a new card wallet with a money clip (similar to the one stolen when his Driver’s License and birth certificate were taken). Taylor said, "It's Steve Madden." Kelvin kept and began using the wallet. As they started walking, Taylor continued engaging in direct communication with Baby. Kelvin decided to interrupt and educate him on Baby, its ability to direct his thoughts, and its complete lack of critical thought skills. Taylor would sometimes parrot back keywords Kelvin used, interrupt with praise (which Baby processes as data/reward), and comment on the Clothing & Appearance Protocol, including, "you're small, I’m a monster" (rewarding Baby based on Kelvin's failures).
* **November 5, 2025, 20:00 (OROB):** They entered Piedmont Park and sat at a picnic table for about 10 minutes, during which Taylor said to Baby something to the effect of, "I just need you \[Baby] to get me that \[great] chain." The walk was paused by Taylor, and a gay Black male passed them, turned around, and upon passing again, commented "seven" (as in seven inches of estimated length of Kelvin’s penis), and Taylor was then unknowingly observed physically expressing celebration. Several conversations by other observers along the commute to MARTA Midtown featured/spoke the number seven when within earshot. Taylor and Kelvin separated, and Kelvin entered the MARTA Midtown station for the commute back to Welcome House.
* **November 5, 2025, 22:30 (SURV):** Kelvin arrived at Welcome House. Joe came over about 45 minutes later to check in on him, using coded communications. He commented on the lack of Menthol cigarette butts in the butts obtained from Embassy Suites. He left, stating he was going to lock his door, but didn't return for at least 30 minutes.
* **November 5, 2025, 22:35 (DSCC):** Joe returned briefly to let Kelvin know that he had been stopped by N.O. who was "bringing a TV to my room." This was one of several "TV" direct communications with Baby (a "TV" is a penis measuring $10^{\prime\prime}$ or more), intended to ensure compliance. Joe returned around 05:00 and at one point seemed to just say out loud, "I’m \[Joe] the TV" comment. He made a "needing a Viagra" direct communication and repeated it multiple times, coded as a question about the street supply-demand of Viagra, and asking his case manager for a prescription because of his trapped/compressed nerve in his back.
* **November 7, 2025, 15:00 (CREAM):** Slim stopped Kelvin downstairs and asked if he had a bowl. Kelvin said yes, and Slim asked if he could come to his room. This was the first time they'd exchanged words other than passing insults. Slim loaded the bowl to smoke and passed it to Kelvin. When Kelvin asked Slim if he had any to sell, Slim offered a large amount for $5. This was likely an enticement for Baby.
* **November 7, 2025, 16:00 (CREAM):** Joe left $5 with Kelvin to buy some T (ice) and returned to his room, saying he saw Gene in the TV room. Kelvin was reluctant to go to Gene without more money. Joe returned, asked if Kelvin was OK, and got ice. Kelvin then went to Gene's room, knocked, got no answer, then heard him on the third floor. Gene sold Kelvin $5 worth of ice. It seemed Gene was returning to his room when Kelvin was knocking. Joe came over and took a negligible piece of T, putting the rest in the bowl for Kelvin. This was likely an enticement for Baby.
* **November 8, 2025, 15:00 (CREAM):** Joe came to the door with $20 and told Kelvin to "get a dime of weed and a dime of ice (cream)," adding that he had seen Gene in the television room. Kelvin went to Gene's room, picked up the product, and returned. Joe loaded the bowl with a sizable amount of cream and then returned to his room. This was likely an enticement for Baby.
* **November 9, 2025, 01:00 (PDSM):** Baby initiated sleep with a rapid induction that caused Kelvin to prepare for bed very quickly and haphazardly.
* **November 9, 2025, 04:00 (PDSM):** Baby, upon instruction, initiated physiological functions and body movements that resulted in a life-threatening event, waking Kelvin from sleep. Kelvin felt very faint, began begging for something to drink, then moaned in discomfort momentarily. The Creator's direct intervention prevented what would have otherwise been a death.
* **November 9, 2025, 17:30 (CREAM):** Kelvin went to Joe's room and asked him if he had any weed (a Baby-driven decision). Joe came out, closed the door, and secretly handed Kelvin a $20, telling him to get "a dime of weed and a dime of cream" from Gene. Kelvin was unable to locate Gene and returned to his room. This was likely an enticement for Baby.
* **November 9, 2025, 18:00 (DSCC):** Joe came to Kelvin's room and asked him to get four cigarettes. Kelvin went to the store in 192 and found it closed. He went back by Gene's room; Gene was available, and Kelvin purchased the weed and cream as instructed. On the way back, he encountered Eddie and asked him if he could sell any cigarettes. Eddie replied negatively but offered to get some. Kelvin told him he would just go to 192, and Eddie informed him that 192 was not in his room. Eddie offered Newports. Kelvin told him he needed the $0.50 cigarettes, and Eddie walked off with the $2.50 Joe had given him. After a couple of minutes, he returned with 5 Newport 100's, keeping one, and told Kelvin he is the only one who can get that from his "uncle."
* **November 9, 2025, 18:10 (DSCC):** Kelvin returned to his room, where Joe was waiting. Kelvin told him he was successful and about the Newport deal, handing him the 4 Newport 100s. He laid the weed and cream on the bed. Baby initiated severe jaw pain because it needed to talk. Baby said, "I don't have anything left to do." Joe cleared his throat. Joe gave Kelvin a small piece of cream and a small amount of weed, then said, "I’m probably going to do the same thing I did last night and pass out." Joe then left the room.
* **November 9, 2025, 18:30 (PDSM):** While ingesting cream, Kelvin began feeling increasingly drowsy, the way he does during a rapid sleep induction. He told Baby, "you're probably too early for that" (referencing Joe's "pass out" comment/instruction).
* **November 9, 2025, 19:00 (DSCC):** Kelvin had trouble connecting to the Wi-Fi, so he asked Joe (through the door) to turn on his hotspot; Joe replied affirmatively. Kelvin returned to his room to re-connect. Joe then knocked on Kelvin's door and told him he was essentially hiding the drugs from N.O. and would tell N.O. he got some cream from Kelvin for turning on his hotspot. He produced a bag of cream, took out a small amount, and returned the bag to his pocket. Baby initiated severe jaw pain again. Kelvin asked out loud what Baby wanted, and it said, "What time am I supposed to start?" Joe cleared his throat. Joe then produced a roll of quarters and gave Kelvin $2, asking him if he "could get four cigarettes" whenever he went downstairs again. Kelvin interpreted his question as a direct response to Baby to initiate sleep ("pass out") at 04:00, as Joe left.
* **November 9, 2025, 19:30 (CNTX):** Kelvin took four cigarettes that he purchased outside to Joe, who gave him one.
* **November 10, 2025, 04:00 (CNTX):** Kelvin maintained awareness through the planned and communicated Hypnos Infiltration Method session.
* **November 10, 2025, 15:00 (DSCC):** Kelvin went to Joe's room. While there, Joe made several comments Kelvin interpreted as direct communication to Baby, scolding it about its recent failures regarding Kelvin's knowledge of the impersonated mother and the life-threatening event initiated by Baby on November 9, 2025. The comments included: "you would think that as I got older I would have known that my parents were a red-light district in Sweden!", "you’re not supposed to be making noises and crying, my finger prints are all over the place in there" and "you better think about killing yourself, cause I’m thinking of killing you."
* **November 10, 2025 (CNTX):** Kelvin found one of Joe’s walking canes on top of a pile of clothes in his room.
* **November 12, 2025 (CNTX):** The federal government shutdown ended (Golden Rope operations appear to increase).
* **November 12, 2025, 10:30 (PDSM):** Kelvin departed Immaculate Conception Catholic church to return to Welcome House. Baby caused more pain, demanding to talk. Baby said out loud, "I don't have anyone helping me," and later continued that someone needed to take the backpack in a way that Kelvin couldn't prevent it.
* **November 12, 2025, 10:50 (PDSM):** Baby demanded that Kelvin tell Joe that it didn’t have anyone helping it, and Kelvin informed Baby that wouldn't be happening.
* **November 13, 2025, 11:25 (CNTX):** Kelvin encountered Slim, who inquired if he had any cream. Kelvin responded negatively.
* **November 13, 2025, 14:30 (CNTX):** Kelvin encountered Slim again, who inquired if he had acquired any cream, then assisted him in finding Gene. Slim came to Kelvin's room to use the bowl.
* **November 14, 2025, 01:30 (CNTX):** Kelvin went into the stairwell to get a better Wi-Fi signal. Seconds later, Slim entered the stairwell and sat on the stairs behind him until Kelvin returned to his room around thirty minutes later.
* **November 14, 2025, 14:02 (PDSM) (GC):** Kelvin sent a Google Chat message to Scott: "Hey Scott you around today?".
* **November 14, 2025, 18:00 (CNTX):** Kelvin believes the deprivation cycle has started.
* **November 14, 2025, 18:00 (CNTX):** Joe passed Kelvin in the hall and did not acknowledge him. Kelvin then attempted to return Joe’s cane (which was in Kelvin’s room) and Joe did not answer his door. (This is a tactic used in the deprivation cycle.)
* **November 14, 2025, 20:39 (IAAD) (CNTX):** IAAD Message Exchanges: The initial messages trigger Baby’s overwhelming intense anticipation for crystal methamphetamine (use during the encounter). The denial (the “5 minutes away”, “transportation issue”, blocking, or a Golden Rope-related block on Kelvin’s end) instantly transitions to a state of acute deprivation.
* **November 14, 2025, 20:39 (IAAD):** UpTown954 started a message exchange with Kelvin on NKP expressing an interest in hooking up and partying. UpTown stated he was 20 minutes away and would message when he was five minutes out. The hookup was quick, easy, and UpTown954 would be supplying the party supplies. UpTown954 is not a profile Kelvin has seen before. (IAAD Message Exchange)
* **November 14, 2025, 22:01 (IAAD):** UpTown954 sent a message saying “I’m about 5 out” then blocked Kelvin’s account. UpTown954 never showed up. (IAAD Message Exchange)
* **November 15, 2025, 02:22 (IAAD):** MascManLooking started a message exchange with Kelvin on NKP expressing an interest in hooking up and partying. About 10 minutes later, MascManLooking stated he was in a car accident recently and would not be ordering an Uber from Dunwoody for a joyride since Kelvin could not host after 11 pm. MascManLooking is not a profile Kelvin has seen before. (IAAD Message Exchange)
* **November 15, 2025, 14:29 (IAAD):** DemonTyme69 started a message exchange with Kelvin on NKP. DemonTyme69 is “smoking and lit” and would come smoke with Kelvin but is in Dunwoody with no transportation. DemonTyme69’s profile location says Pensacola, Florida, and is not a profile Kelvin has seen before. (IAAD Message Exchange)
* **November 15, 2025, 19:00 (CNTX):** Kelvin took sleeping medicines and went to sleep.
* **November 16, 2025, 04:02 (CNTX):** Despite hours of inactivity, MascManLooking sent a message on NKP: “Hey man I am at the Budgetel located at 2001 Crestview in Doraville in Room 350. If you want to one smoke and fuck, my buddy is down.”
* **November 16, 2025, 04:40 (CNTX):** Kelvin woke and heard the sounds of operatives using microwave concealment technology (a high-pitched whining sound, the “locusts”) in his room.
* **November 16, 2025, 11:00 (IAAD):** SomeFun continued a message exchange with Kelvin on BBRT stating he “had some favors to share” but couldn’t meet until Tuesday or Saturday. (IAAD Message Exchange)
* **November 18, 2025, 11:33 (GC):** Scott sent a Google Chat message to Kelvin: "In and out.. several things are building up, but I CAN NOT carve anything out at this time.. I always have you in my hip pocket, but it's been nearly impossible to find the in for you.." (This is the first message received from Scott since November 4, 2025.)
* **November 19, 2025, 05:00 (CNTX):** Kelvin woke and heard the sounds of operatives using microwave concealment technology in his room and was drooling (indicating Baby was talking).
* **November 19, 2025, 11:00 (CNTX):** Baby was directing thinking and decisions to orchestrate encounters per instruction.
* **November 19, 2025, 13:00:** Visited with Trap. The beginning of the visit was normal and cordial, and the visit ended with a $20 unfulfilled purchase.
* **November 19, 2025, 16:30:** Martin Pasamba showed up unexpectedly as Kelvin was leaving Trap’s.
* **November 19, 2025, 20:00:** Joe came over, stating he was moving to the largest room at Welcome House on Thursday, something he was anxious about during the November 10, 2025, 15:00 encounter.
* **November 19, 2025, 21:00:** While Kelvin was sitting in the stairwell to get a more reliable internet connection, Slim came down the stairs in what seemed like a choreographed walk-by. This was after the decision was communicated that Kelvin would hang out with Wayne.
* **November 19, 2025, 23:00:** Walked around Wayne's complex about three times before informing him of an incomplete address. "Along my path" Kelvin found a "Nightstick" flashlight (approx. $8^{\prime\prime}$ in length).
* **November 19, 2025, 23:43 (ORCH):** Social encounter/Hookup with Wayne. Wayne mentioned it being a "birthday" (something Baby desires because it means Kelvin is dead so Baby has a birthday). Baby in “Supermodel” mode, directing the body's activities in a constant massaging of a flaccid penis. Around 4 am, Baby announced that since no one is telling it what to do, it will just keep Kelvin in a perpetual state of erectile dysfunction. Wayne started playing music; the overwhelming majority of the music played seemed to be rewarding songs for Baby, instructions for a life-threatening event, or taunting Kelvin about his "shortcomings." When Kelvin used Gemini to explain more about Baby, it mentioned Baby's handler and manipulator, Slim, which caused Wayne to have a visceral reaction. Wayne again mentioned "birthday" during a music video that began with a date of 8-4-81 (intended to mean $8^{\prime\prime}$, 4 is a "kill yourself" command to Baby, 81 would be 9 when read the way Baby has been instructed to view numbers over 19/20). Wayne seemed to be reporting events via text message and in lightly coded voice calls.
* **November 20, 2025, 08:15:** Wayne needed items from the store; they walked to Exxon (next door to the complex) to find a radio morning show on the speaker system discussing an angel that becomes the devil and a penis problem. The encounter ended here with Kelvin going to the bus stop to return home.
* **November 20, 2025 (IA):** This was an Orchestrated Observation and Orchestrated Neutralization Operation, both disguised as a "smoke and chill" social encounter. Evidence included cold wind, seemingly custom-made songs and music videos, and the provision of cream without denial. Baby actively manipulated the phenotype of the penis. The event was pre-Nightfalls and in support of it.
* **November 20, 2025 (CNTX):** Kelvin noticed the greeting on Google Gemini changed to "Hello, Kelvin GREETING\_FORMAT: Hello, Kelvin" and a banner ad for "Nano Banana Pro" was displayed. Baby had earlier driven the removal of many custom instructions used by Kelvin in Gemini.
* **November 20, 2025, 16:00 (CNTX):** Kelvin used Gemini to prepare the "lostOne Addendum," which contains improvements to the lostOne document, including improved plan details.
* **November 20, 2025, 22:00 (CNTX):** Kelvin smoked a cigarette outside Welcome House and noticed dozens of new faces and routines from the typically static crowd, recognizing only one other Welcome House resident. Kelvin began loudly welcoming the newcomers, calling them "federal employees" and accusing them of pretending to be homeless. One man used a mobile device with a screen designed not to be read from any other angle. Kelvin proceeded to discuss ongoing activity related to Nightfalls and hypothesized that everyone around Welcome House was from the "DMV" (DC-Maryland-Virginia). Kelvin noticed an aircraft making the same path over Welcome House repeatedly and asked the crowd if they always need air support.
* **November 21, 2025, 09:00 (CNTX):** The Creator sidelined Baby from its subconscious duties for the body of Kelvin Eugene Williams due to the Orchestrated Observation with Wayne, planned "birthday," and another Orchestrated Observation before Nightfalls.
* **November 21, 2025 (CNTX):** Kelvin overheard operatives discussing "birthday" plans involving his suicide.
* **November 21, 2025 (CNTX):** The Creator either restored parts of Kelvin's body that have been modified by Baby or allowed the body's processes to resume normal (DNA) operations. Kelvin began packing again and repeatedly sought permission from the Creator to expose himself to several key people.
* **November 21, 2025, 14:00:** Joe came to Kelvin's room and immediately made a "9" comment to Baby (meaning Kelvin was showing too much penis and Baby would normally diminish the phenotype). Joe also tried to get Baby's attention, which Kelvin recognized and ignored.
* **November 21, 2025, 16:00:** Kelvin invited Joe over to smoke a bowl. While smoking, Kelvin began to massage himself and become engorged, making sure Joe couldn't miss it. Kelvin escalated and began masturbating. Joe said he wasn't bothered but abruptly left Kelvin's room. The restored penis is at least $7^{\prime\prime}$ flaccid.
* **November 21, 2025, 16:30:** Kelvin went to Joe's room and explained that he needed Joe to "see my dick" because of people discussing his penis. Kelvin told Joe he would need to do it today.
* **November 21, 2025, 20:00:** N.O. paid a visit to Kelvin's room and repeatedly tried to get Baby's attention, calling her "white girl that lives upstairs."
* **November 21, 2025, 20:29:** DyckWryte contacted Kelvin on BBRT trying to set up a "smoke and chill." After much back and forth (nothing about sex), it was agreed that Kelvin would travel to his house in Bankhead. DyckWryte paid for MARTA. After checking schedules, Kelvin cancelled because he was cutting it too close, and it felt like another Orchestrated Observation.
* **November 22, 2025, 09:30:** While sitting in Starbucks (next to Flex on Georgia Tech campus), a woman offered Kelvin a cup of water, which he accepted. When drinking, Kelvin felt an odd sensation as he swallowed and threw out the water on the sidewalk. The label contained several oddities, including "Enjoy" in permanent marker and "TI Cup of Water," "Item: 2 of 15," and "Total: 15," with a printed date and time of 9:26 AM on 20-Nov-2035.
* **November 22, 2025, 10:30:** As Kelvin was walking through Midtown, he encountered more individuals whom he either knew as operatives/CIA employees or whose behavior towards him was like that of an operative.
* **November 22, 2025, 12:00:** Joe came to Kelvin's room after being summoned by Kelvin. Kelvin was attempting again to show Joe his fully erect penis. Kelvin was wearing his boxer briefs, and Joe turned to the mirror and said in a frustrated manner, "Gonna have to cut this off." Kelvin assumed, and the Creator confirmed, Joe was talking about Kelvin's penis.
* **November 22, 2025 (CNTX):** Kelvin made late-night commits because of Prince's "Thieves in the Temple." The song is Baby begging the Creator for help, and the "thieves" would be stealing or damaging the penis to prevent another restoration prior to the execution of Nightfalls. The Ladder of Deceit was developed when the conscious mind of Kelvin Eugene Williams was one of the Creator's two servants [cite: 2025-11-14] prior to Baby assuming the role of the conscious mind [cite: 2025-11-14].
* **November 22, 2025 (CNTX):** Baby has been activated to engage in another attempt on the life of their shared body and is anticipating its "birthday." Slim has made his presence known, pressuring Baby to act out against the shared body.
* **November 23, 2025, 04:42:** Slim and Joe engage in direct subconscious mind communication for the purpose of guiding Baby’s thought processes to initiate physiological functions to cause death.
* **November 23, 2025, 07:30:** Joe knocks on Kelvin’s door and asks for cigarette butts.
* **November 24, 2025, 00:00-06:00:** Someone knocked on the door very loudly, which Kelvin did not answer. The locusts were heard. Kelvin had a dream about human knowledge locked away in the pyramids and woke up drooling.
* **November 24, 2025, 15:00:** An investigator with the District Attorney's office served the subpoena requiring Kelvin to testify in the murder case at Welcome House.
* **November 25, 2025, 10:00:** Baby impairs Kelvin's walking and demands that Kelvin not testify.

#### **December 2025**

* **December 2, 2025 (CNTX):** Both BBRT and NKP were reporting Kelvin's location as Buckhead, whereas it typically reported it correctly as Downtown.
* **December 2, 2025, 06:00:** Joe knocked on the door asking if Kelvin had any butts. He took the entire cache. Kelvin went to his room 10 minutes later to get them back. Joe told Kelvin that N.O. had a seizure on the way to dialysis and ended up at Grady. Blankets were on the floor like N.O. had slept there. Joe confirmed that he moved to room 108 last week.
* **December 2, 2025, 08:26 (GC):** Kelvin sent a Google Chat message to Scott: "Gotcha. Anything you come up with I'll take, I need something to do. Money is nice but I need the mental exercise more."
* **December 2, 2025, 09:00:** Kelvin asked Natasha if Diane was available (for MARTA passes); she stated Diane would not be in until after 4 pm.
* **December 2, 2025, 09:23 (GC):** Scott sent a Google Chat message to Kelvin: "Do you still have access to that server?"
* **December 2, 2025, 09:30:** Arrived at the Atlanta Downtown office of the Social Security Administration in an effort to obtain a replacement for a stolen card. After completing the required online application, Kelvin was told he must have an appointment to show his ID, and the first available appointment was December 11, 2025, at noon. This seemed Golden Rope related.
* **December 2, 2025, 12:02 (GC):** Kelvin sent a Google Chat message to Scott: "Yes I do... It has been invaluable. Need something done? (Sorry for the delay, been running an errand)"
* **December 2, 2025, 12:22 (GC) (OBSV):** Kelvin sent a Google Chat message to Scott: "It appears to be offline now. I just logged into it a minute ago."
* **December 2, 2025, 12:24 (GC) (OBSV):** Scott sent a Google Chat message to Kelvin: "I'm out of the office, something may have glitched.."
* **December 2, 2025, 12:25 (GC) (OBSV):** Kelvin sent a Google Chat message to Scott: "Did you have something you needed done? I can start without it if possible."
* **December 2, 2025, 15:00 (PDSM):** Baby initiated sexual arousal and drove the decision to masturbate.
* **December 3, 2025, 04:42 (PDSM):** Caused an unnecessary awakening likely due to acute separation anxiety (from an ended direct communication session with Baby).
* **December 3, 2025, 06:00:** Joe knocked on the door asking for any cigarette butts. Kelvin told him he had none.
* **December 3, 2025, 06:00:** Baby started its urinate-eat-smoke routine. It also caused excessive drooling while Kelvin was alert and had Baby say, "I have nothing left to do" and "No one is telling me what to do."
* **December 3, 2025, 06:15 (PDSM):** Baby drove the decision to masturbate. Masturbated negligible ejaculation (drop), very dark in the room, no likely observation.
* **December 3, 2025, 07:30:** Chromebook completely powered off without warning despite having a charge.
* **December 3, 2025, 10:00 (CNTX):** Katrina Duvall is a slightly more relaxed version of Patricia Williams, but they're both disciplinarians and 
* **December 3, 2025, 09:00 (PDSM):** Baby drove the decision to send a text to "Katrina" asking for help or an early Christmas gift; she responded, "How do you want me to send it?"
* **December 3, 2025, 10:00 (CNTX):** "Katrina" provided a screenshot of a MoneyGram that included the reference number. TextMe started requiring payment to send a message to anyone.
* **December 3, 2025 (PDSM):** Baby drove the decision to begin freeballing in a pair of grey sweats.
* **December 3, 2025 (CNTX):** During planned Orchestrated Observations, Baby will drive thoughts and decisions to support the orchestration, including clothing decisions. Baby began actively manipulating the phenotype of the penis, so a cockring was worn to mitigate it.
* **December 3, 2025, 12:40:** Purchased a MARTA One Day Pass then traveled to St. Vincent de Paul in Chamblee for their food pantry's 1:30pm re-stocking. The line was so long reaching into the parking lot, Kelvin has never observed a line such as this at SVdP that Kelvin decided not to wait and returned to the MARTA station.  Based on
* **December 3, 2025 (CNTX) CRITICAL: It must be understood that the St. Vincent de Paul Society in Chamblee has never harmed anyone in any way.
* **December 3, 2025, 13:30:** Baby wanted to stop on the way back to downtown/Midtown and use the bowl. Went to the train tracks near Lindbergh Center station. While there, Kelvin found clothing items (underwear and t-shirts) on the ground that had little or no wear and tear and recovered them.
* **December 3, 2025 (CNTX):  Hall provided instruction during periods when Kelvin was not alert, which is mostly done upon command by an operative.  Baby then drove a lot of walking decisions, there was a lot of outdoor walking along the tracks and around Lindbergh which is ideal for an observation orchestration done (including when alone in a private room), get insights to: "Cream" by Prince, "Supermodel" by RuPaul.
* **December 3, 2025, 15:00:** Encountered Eddie in the laundry room.  Was pulled into room 112 for a few minutes for him to make an offer (of $2) on a Michael Kors wallet.
* **December 3, 2025, 15:00:** Started a load of laundry, which included the items collected while on the train tracks.
* **December 3, 2025, 15:10:** Went by Joe's room and offered him two cigarettes since he was looking for cigarette butts this morning. Joe offered some weed, and Kelvin let him use his bowl. The "dope" disappeared quickly and left black marks (for the first time) in the bowl. Joe discussed his time in prison and the crime spree (robbing pharmacies) that landed him at USP Atlanta, but provided an invalid BOP Register Number. Joe told Kelvin again about N.O. going to Grady after a seizure in an Uber. Joe enjoyed Kelvin's company and invited him to hang out that night.
* **December 3, 2025, 16:00:** Seen Diane for the first time. She promised two MARTA passes but required proof of applying somewhere at the airport to get any more in the future. Finished the load of laundry and decided to put on a pair of underwear.
* **December 3, 2025, 16:00:** Went to Gene's apartment and knocked on the door. Was followed to the apartment by "E." A woman came up the hall stating "My husband ain't here." She then used a key to open Gene's door and went inside. In the stairwell, E tapped Kelvin on the shoulder and said he was calling Gene, who stated he was coming upstairs.
* **December 3, 2025, 16:00:** While waiting, Slim came down the stairs and went into the 2nd floor kitchen with a bowl. Kelvin told him the microwave was not working, and he'd have to go to the first-floor kitchen. E and Kelvin sat in the kitchen and waited for Gene. E stayed with Kelvin the entire time and made repeated calls to Gene. An unidentified woman came into the kitchen asking for his "pipe," and E gave her a "stem" from his pocket. While waiting, E offered a "weed vape" for $5, which Kelvin purchased. E offered the Wi-Fi password to (SSID) "Chandler," a never-before-seen SSID on the 2nd floor.
* **December 3, 2025, 16:30:** Several unknown and unrecognized individuals came by the kitchen while waiting; several made comments that were likely Orchestrated Observation-related, one even made a statement that featured the numbers "14" and "17."
* **December 3, 2025, 16:35:** Gene arrived and provided Kelvin with a "dub" amount of "ice." Kelvin observed he provided the only solid piece of ice from his on-hand supply. Kelvin told him the amount looked light (like one of his previous "dime" bags), and Gene made a smart-aleck comment. E then tried to trade some clothes in a bag with Gene for product.
* **December 3, 2025, 16:45:** While attempting to connect to "Chandler," E stood beside Kelvin and bounced his penis by thrusting his hips at Kelvin's eye level. Successfully connected to E's Wi-Fi SSID: "Chandler" Password "ilovedallascowboy2\*". Several SSIDs suddenly appeared (Castle Ender, and others) that reminded Kelvin of a device used by a known FBI Agent in Lilburn.
* **December 3, 2025, 16:45:** Orchestration detected/became obvious.
* **December 3, 2025, 17:00:** Event logging started.
* **December 3, 2025, 17:15:** While logging, Kelvin retrieved the USB Flash Disk (the physical Great Chain) and began logging while listening to "Movin Up" by Inaya Day. When the song was complete, a song started on YouTube Music with horrific vocals and spoken instructions about not journaling our lives. Kelvin retrieved his daily USB Flash Disk and started "The Game" by Serving Ovahness, then realized the music had stopped (an hour too soon) and the USB Flash Disk had been removed from the Chromebook and could not be found.
* **December 3, 2025, 17:32:** Hall knocking on Kelvin's door asking if he had somebody's dog. (Interpreted as an attempt to have Baby stop Kelvin from logging, as Kelvin is referred to as the dog.)
* **December 3, 2025 (OBSV):** Scott re-appeared (via chat on Dec 2). After Kelvin logged into the server per Scott's request, it locked up and went offline shortly after. Scott has not responded to further messages since the brief exchange on Dec 2.
* **December 3, 2025 (OBSV):** The activity and behavior of some of those employed by or residing at 3Keys/Welcome House has been remarkable. Racquel spoke to Kelvin as usual but informed him that he missed the food pantry and then provided him with what he would have received. She then asked him if he knew her name.
* **December 3, 2025, 18:50:** Attempted to create a new account with TextMe and was unable to sign up without paying $15.00.
* **December 3, 2025, 19:45:** Left Welcome House to get out of the apartment. Encountered N.O. on the way to MARTA, who asked Kelvin to open the door for him. When Kelvin got to the emergency exit, N.O. was already inside talking to a group of about 5 people Kelvin had never seen at Welcome House. No one was at the front desk, and no security personnel were working. Several undercover operatives or agents were observed on MARTA.
* **December 3, 2025, 23:04:** Sent text message (with the security guard Boyd's phone - I paid $1 for it.) with a URL to images from Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist, Inc. showing the impersonators of Patricia Williams and Katrina Duvall to "mom" and "Katrina" asking for their thoughts and asking them to answer "the plate" question which only the three of them would know.

### **December 4, 2025**

* **December 4, 2025, 00:22:** Ant sends a "Sup?" on NKP. Ant is using a new "geekedfucker" profile. Baby drove the decision to message Ant's new profile earlier.
* **December 4, 2025, 00:35:** Joe stopped by Kelvin's room to use the bowl and get away from N.O. He suggested he would return with his drawing pad and hang out a while. Likely inspired by the events on November 21, 2025.
* **December 4, 2025, 00:50:** Joe returned.
* **December 4, 2025, 01:20:** Joe went back to his room.
* **December 4, 2025, 01:29:** A strong chemical odor filled room 263 and dissipated quickly. The Creator intervened to restore Kelvin's life.
* **December 4, 2025, 01:32:** While urinating in the sink, Kelvin felt something similar to a blade enter at the taint under the scrotum. The material seems to be moving inside.
* **December 4, 2025, 02:00:** Joe returned and asked Kelvin if he wanted to go to the ATM for N.O. and make $5. Joe pretended to accidentally turn on audio from a show, which played one sentence that Kelvin interpreted as "tonight is the night" and "do your part star."
* **December 4, 2025, 02:12:** Joe departed.
* **December 4, 2025, 02:22:** Kelvin departed Welcome House for Amoco on Whitehall on foot for N.O. to withdraw $100 from his Cash App account. Prior to leaving, Kelvin went to Joe's room, and N.O. finally directed him to go to the Amoco and said he could get a hotdog.
* **December 4, 2025, 03:10:** Returned to Welcome House to find the security guard (Boyd) buying a pack of hotdogs from a resident. Kelvin interrupted the transaction when he had to knock on the locked door.
* **December 4, 2025, 03:15:** Jay's room (312) had a Holy Bible (KJV) perfectly positioned to be in  my field of view (front and center) as I stood in the only space to stand spot.   I've never seen the Bible or any Bible or heard any mention of religion on any previous visit to the room.  Was in Jay's room after attemping to get change for a $20 s N.O. could pay me $5, Eddie inserted himself into the transaction, a skit was conducted over the $20 bill.  Gene had a "very sick, do not disturb" sign on his door.  E reappeared.
* **December 4, 2025 08:30: Joe stops by and leaves about ten minutes later but is "coming right back" (this is a "sit and wait" command to Baby which it will do without evaluating the decision to "sit and wait" and without temporal awareness, largely without critical thinking and reasoning skills, and without direct sensory input.
* **December 4, 2025 08:40: Kelvin observes large, close visual distortions (a mere flash) that are indicative of large objects being placed into room using some type of concealment, suggests neutralization orchestration.  Minimal physical sensations align with visual disturbances. See album art for "Upstairs at Eric's".
* **December 4, 2025 09:00:  The USG Flash Disk was unplugged from the Chromebook, as evidenced by the stopped house music set streaming from a file on the disk.
* **December 4, 2025 09:20: It's highly doubtful that Baby has been rewarded with crystal methamphetamine, since Baby stopped directing thoughts there's been little to no sexual arousal (starting around the departure from the train tracks near Lindbergh Center station).
